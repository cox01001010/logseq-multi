Dear Guangxin,

I'm sorry for taking so long to reply. I have been on holiday the last couple of weeks and am just beginning to catch up.

I'll get back to you in the next couple of days with our thoughts on the two options you propose:

A. New replacement cryostat

B. Swapping the detector into a cryostat you already own.

Before answering I would like to check the details of proposal B with you.

Would you wish to keep the original detector in this cryostat as well when we install the detector from the broken red cryostat?

Are both detectors downward looking?

Do you have photographs of the inside of both detector systems? I would be interested to see the 4K cold plates to assess how much space we have.

When did you last put cryogens into the orange cryostat? Do you recall how long it held cryogens for?

With thanks and best regards,

James
