Dear Guangxin,

Thank you for explaining the problem. Unfortunately, from what you describe, there is a major problem with the cryostat that would need to be returned to us for repair.

There is a long (~~ 200mm) tube that connects the Helium fill port on the top plate to the Helium can. The tube is welded to the He can but this joint can be broken if the He can moves relative to the top plate. This can happen if the support struts on the cold plate break but it does usually require a lot of force or rough handling.

You may not be able to answer this, but was the detector significantly moved prior to it’s loss of vacuum two years ago? I am off site at the moment, so am unable to check the serial numbers, but I think this system is several years old so I am assuming there has been years of use prior to this problem.

If you arrange to send the system back to us, we can investigate the leak and advise on the most cost-efficient way to get you operational again. We can also tell you about our range of detector systems that use pulse tube coolers if that convenience would be useful to you. I haven’t checked, but I am fairly sure your detector could be directly installed into one of these coolers. This would enable you to run continuously without the need for liquid cryogen transfer.

You will need to use the transit plates and a strong box (ideally the flight case the system was supplied with) when you return the system otherwise the detector will become broken too.

Sorry for the bad news,

James
