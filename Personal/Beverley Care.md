Hi Beverley,

Thanks for updating us about the indemnity. Have you been able to speak to the seller’s solicitor since your email last week. Do you know that they have actually taken out the indemnity?

We’re increasingly concerned as it’s beginning to feel as if things have been left incomplete and we are having to chase for things we have paid for.

Can you please assure us that once we have the FENSA indemnity we then have everything that is due to us and that things are complete?
