# caveat about renewals:

Renewal Premiums

Although some people find the initial premium from  Petplan to be relatively expensive, our research suggests that they do have a reputation for moderate premium increases. They also state that at the present time they will not increase your premiums simply because you have made claims or your pet has developed a long-term condition.    In our opinion therefore despite the initial premium they may well be a “cheaper” long term option than many other policies which offer a cheaper initial premium.

Renewal Premiums

Our research found many reviews complaining about high renewal premium increases.   Unfortunately this seems to be common for many of the policies underwritten by RSA.
