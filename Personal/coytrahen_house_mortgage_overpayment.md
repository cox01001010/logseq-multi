You have an annual overpayment allowance on this Loan of 10.00% of the balance of the Loan outstanding at  
the start of each year, which applies from the date the rate is applied to your loan and then each year on the  
anniversary of this date until the end of the Early Repayment Charge period. If you do not use your annual  
overpayment allowance in any year, it will not be carried over to a subsequent year.
