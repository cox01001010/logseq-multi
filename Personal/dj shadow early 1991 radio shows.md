 From The DJ Shadow Archives - KMEL Mix #1 (1991)
By DJ Shadow
Electronica, Hip Hop, Dj Mix

"For a brief time beginning in early 1991, for one hour a month, I was able to command the airwaves of the largest urban radio station in San Francisco...and my agenda was to bring the real. These were among the first all-rap (no R&B, no crossover) to ever air on commercial radio in the Bay Area. It was made on my 4-track cassette recorder, and I threw the kitchen sink at it. Dedicated to my mixshow heroes who came before me: Michael Erickson, Dave Moss, Theo, Cameron Paul, Alexander Mejia, and King Tech."- DJ Shadow
