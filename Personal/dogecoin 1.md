# What You’ll Need to Get Started Mining Dogecoin

Before you can start mining and subsequently make it rain Doge, you’ll need a few things to make it happen.

-   **Hardware**. To start, any Windows, Mac OS, or Linux system will do. Basic machines are great to experiment with but scaling will require some more serious hardware including GPUs and ASICs.
-   **Software**. Depending on your OS and hardware the software can vary. Here are a few examples.
    -   CPU Mining: [cpuminer](https://sourceforge.net/projects/cpuminer/) by Pooler
    -   GPU Mining: [EasyMiner](https://sourceforge.net/projects/easyminer/?source=directory) is a good place to start out.
    -   ASIC Mining: [CGMiner](https://sourceforge.net/projects/cgminer/) and open source [MutliMiner](https://github.com/nwoolls/MultiMiner/releases)
-   **Dogecoin Wallet**. You’ll need somewhere to send your mined Doge.

At this point, you could jump into mining, but remember that going it alone and mining Dogecoin solo is really tricky to make a profit, especially one worth your time. Instead, tap into a Dogecoin mining pool and take advantage of some that sweet sweet synergy.

-   **Mining Pools. You’ll need a pool that supports Scrypt mining, here are a couple of good ones to get you started.**
-   -   -   [Prohashing](https://prohashing.com/): X11, Equihash, SHA-256, and Scrypt mining pools.
        -   [Multipool](https://www.multipool.us/dashboard/pool/doge): Supports merged mining of Litecoin and Dogecoin.
-   **Pro tip:** If Dogecoin is your absolute endgame here, consider mining other Scrypt coins and selling them for Dogecoin. You can net more Doge with less hashing power.
