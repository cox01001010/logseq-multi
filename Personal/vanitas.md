from wikipedia:

A _**vanitas**_ is a symbolic work of art showing the [transience](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temporality "Temporality") of life, the futility of pleasure, and the certainty of death, often contrasting symbols of wealth and symbols of [ephemerality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ephemerality "Ephemerality") and death. Best-known are _vanitas_ [still lifes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Still_life "Still life"), a common genre in [Low countries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Art_of_the_Low_Countries "Art of the Low Countries") of the 16th and 17th centuries; they have also been created at other times and in other [media](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medium_(art) "Medium (art)") and [genres](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genre#Visual_arts "Genre").[\[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vanitas#cite_note-1)

Common vanitas symbols include skulls, which are a reminder of the certainty of death; rotten fruit (decay); bubbles (the brevity of life and suddenness of death); smoke, watches, and hourglasses (the brevity of life); and musical instruments (brevity and the ephemeral nature of life). Fruit, flowers and butterflies can be interpreted in the same way, and a peeled lemon was, like life, attractive to look at but bitter to taste. Art historians debate how much, and how seriously, the vanitas theme is implied in still-life paintings without explicit imagery such as a skull. As in much moralistic genre painting, the enjoyment evoked by the sensuous depiction of the subject is in a certain conflict with the moralistic message.[\[6\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vanitas#cite_note-6)

_Composition of flowers_ is a less obvious style of Vanitas by [Abraham Mignon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abraham_Mignon "Abraham Mignon") in the [National Museum, Warsaw](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Museum,_Warsaw "National Museum, Warsaw"). Barely visible amid vivid and perilous nature (snakes, poisonous mushrooms), a bird skeleton is a symbol of vanity and shortness of life.
