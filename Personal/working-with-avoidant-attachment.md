# Working with Avoidant Attachment 

Could we be doing more for highly defended clients? Attachment-based psychoanalytic psychotherapist Linda Cundy believes so. Embarking on a monthly blog series on working with avoidant attachment, she introduces some common characteristics among avoidant clients, and suggests four key ways in which therapists can help to engage them in therapy. 

When I run training days on working with avoidant clients, I ask participants to brainstorm words they associate with this group of individuals. The kind of words and phrases they come up with include: “cold”, “aloof”, “unfeeling”, “critical”, “arrogant”, “narcissistic”, “unempathic”. I also hear: “hard-working”, “driven”, “perfectionist”, “independent” or “‘on the spectrum’”.”  It seems difficult to empathise with them.

‘Avoidant’ – or ‘dismissing’ – are terms from attachment research to describe a way of being that emphasises self-reliance and downplays emotions. They (or maybe we – there are plenty of people in the helping professions who would fit the description) are expert in defending themselves from painful thoughts, emotions and memories, perhaps by focusing on the outside world, targets and deadlines, facts rather than feelings. Or they may have a private inner world but defend it from any intrusion. (For an example of this latter version of avoidance, listen to the Simon and Garfunkel song, I am a Rock.)

Such people may become workaholics or bullies (if they have been on the receiving end of that kind of aggression themselves). Some may be ‘geeks’ who prefer computers to people. Some appear haughty and tend to ridicule others or pull rank, or are stiff and formal. Others seem almost invisible, demanding very little attention from the world. Despite the myriad creative defences used to protect the self from unwanted emotional distress, what they have in common is a core anxiety of being rejected.

Attachment research suggests that, in early life, these individuals suffered a consistent lack of response to their ordinary needs for comfort, reassurance and affection. Rejection can take many forms, from the subtle to the gross, but as small children they gave up hope of being intimately cared for and learned to be precociously self-reliant.

In my experience, most avoidant people then develop a very demanding and difficult relationship with themselves characterised by a highly critical superego, or punitive internal object. Alice Miller wrote, ‘The way we were treated as small children is the way we treat ourselves the rest of our life. And we often impose our most agonizing suffering upon ourselves’. Feeling that they failed to be what their parents wanted, they torment themselves with unrealistic demands and torture themselves over perceived failures.

They believe themselves to be fundamentally flawed and punish themselves for this mercilessly. So their defences also keep other people at arm’s length, not allowing anyone close enough to see what they feel to be their deficiency. Although they may be high achievers, even occupying positions of power, they suffer a great deal of shame.

Because of the imperative to manage alone, and often the contempt for emotions or relationship, fewer avoidant individuals present for therapy than those with more anxious attachment patterns. However, they do come, perhaps ‘sent’ by partners who are frustrated by the lack of intimate communication or sensitive care. But when they come, they often resist engaging and leave quickly. We need to do better for them.

We need to…

    Build a relationship slowly (it takes a long time for them to trust), but prove ourselves useful fairly quickly
    Be highly sensitive to the shame they feel (but hide so effectively from us and themselves)
    Notice and point out how tough they can be on themselves, and be interested in knowing more about that. In time, when they are settled into therapy, we can challenge them on their self-hatred
    Enjoy them (as children, they probably felt that their parents did NOT enjoy them) – humour can be a way of connecting playfully


# Working with Avoidant Attachment: Assessment

Why is it important to recognise avoidant attachment patterns early in therapy, and what might we look out for? In her second blog about working with highly defended clients, Attachment-based psychoanalytic psychotherapist Linda Cundy explains why the therapeutic relationship poses such a problem for avoidant individuals – and shares some key features that may show up in assessment.

There are five broad categories of attachment pattern: Secure, Dismissing, Preoccupied, Unresolved and Cannot Classify. This blog series focuses on one – Dismissing – commonly called Avoidant. People who are ‘avoidant’ have a whole array of defences that cut them off from painful (and ‘shameful’) feelings, needs and memories, and also prevent others from getting close.

There are good reasons why it is helpful to recognise this pattern of attachment early on in therapeutic work. These individuals are less likely to consider therapy in the first place than those who are more preoccupied or unresolved. They are more wary and defended, and so less likely to stay. If we recognise their particular struggles we can be more sensitive and skilful.

For any prospective client there are always mixed feelings at the start of a therapy – some hope that it will be useful (even transformative) but inevitably also anticipating that it will be either useless or damaging. From an attachment perspective we see the influence of internal working models, or relational models that develop in early life through experiences with caregivers. These predispose us to believe that other people are either fundamentally well-meaning and helpful, or frustrating, hurtful or downright disturbing.

The problem for avoidant individuals is the therapeutic relationship. The expectation of not being understood, being shamed and rejected is particularly powerful because their attachment figures consistently rejected their needs for comfort, reassurance and affection. Self-sufficiency becomes highly valued and reliance on, or intimacy with, other people is shunned. (It may also be longed-for, but that is deeply buried.)

So when a potential client who is avoidant arrives at the door, the balance of hope and hopelessness will be more heavily stoked on the side of hopelessness. It is our job to provide enough hope to bring the client back next session, to make a connection and engage curiosity but without threatening his or her defences.

So how can we tell if a potential client is avoidant? The points listed here are, of course, stereotypical rather than exhaustive:

    First contact: from my experience, avoidant individuals are less likely to make initial contact by telephone than email, text etc.
    Presenting issue: typically work-related, or an indication that therapy is a last-ditch attempt to save a struggling relationship
    What is wanted: often just a few sessions to focus on a specific issue and provide tools to help the client manage without therapy
    First meeting: the client may either try to control the meeting by steering the focus away from the past and painful issues, or is uncomfortable talking about him- or herself in any detail
    : Bollas (The Shadow of the Object) writes about how the therapist is ‘used’ by clients to recreate certain types of relationship and situations that are familiar from early life. I often notice that my attempts to be helpful are blocked or, in some situations, I am not allowed to be empathic. I assume that this harks back to how things were in childhood. And sometimes I feel like an interrogator trying to extract information from an obstinate prisoner!

Although conducting and coding the Adult Attachment Interview (AAI) requires specialist training, this cornerstone of attachment research suggests further clues to listen out for in therapy. Key features of interviewees classified ‘dismissing’ include:

    Little emotional vocabulary, even when asked to describe distressing experiences (separations, losses, bereavements etc.)
    Little elaboration or detail regarding attachment-related material (AAIs with avoidant people are usually shorter than with other interviewees for this reason)
    Childhood and parents idealised or described as either “fine” or “normal”
    Apparently few or no childhood memories
    Presenting self as competent, independent, not needy
    Past difficulties in life presented as positive experiences
    Little curiosity about internal world and motives – their own or others’ – the ‘unexamined life’

Next time I will write about the early stages of therapy with avoidant clients. If we are able to keep them, help them feel safe enough to benefit from therapy, we will also be rewarded – it is a wonderful privilege to see them thaw, come to life, discover their own emotions and internal worlds, become more playful, spontaneous, creative and relational.

### Working with Avoidant Attachment: Early Stages

How might we begin to work with clients with avoidant attachment patterns? In her third blog about working with highly defended clients, Attachment-based psychoanalytic psychotherapist Linda Cundy shares how she has engaged clients who have learned to hide their needs and avoid commitment.

Patterns of attachment describe how we typically:

    relate to other people, especially when we are frightened, ill, stressed or distressed – how we ‘seek attachment’
    relate to ourselves – based on the kind of early relationship with caregivers that we have internalised

and also…

    the core anxiety that drives us (fear of abandonment, fear of rejection, fear of intrusion…)
    the kind of defences we adopt to deal with these anxieties

The Avoidant (or ‘Dismissing’) pattern is characterised by not turning to others or seeking help in any obvious ways. In the Strange Situation Test, one of the major attachment research projects, a toddler of 12-15 months is described as having an Avoidant pattern of attachment with his parent if he does not appear to need reassurance in an unfamiliar environment or when a strange person tries to engage him. He does not object when the parent leaves him alone with the stranger, and does not seek comfort when the parent returns.

But when small sensor pads are attached to the skin of children taking part in the SST, those who show no obvious distress are actually found to be highly anxious. By the age of 15 months, they have learned to contain their distress and hide their need for, and from others.

Repressed needs and self-sufficiency

It is important that therapists understand how much practice our avoidant clients have had at repressing and denying their need for others. They have usually developed impressive skills as a result of being self-sufficient (for instance they may be very high achievers) and this needs to be acknowledged and valued – especially as these clients are so prone to shame.

In an early session with an older woman, the client was talking about her career. I didn’t feel we were connecting and was concerned she would leave therapy. I raised my hand to catch her attention then said; “You know, you really were a pioneer in your field. You achieved remarkable things by any standards but I imagine it was particularly tough for a woman at that time”. I immediately felt the atmosphere change. She was so used to being criticised, of having to fight her corner. In that moment we connected as two professional women, and a real warmth developed between us. I had met her deeply buried longing to be seen and appreciated.

Getting started

Many avoidant clients have arrived saying: “I’m not interested in the past, I just want to address a current issue”. On my website I now make it very clear how I work, giving information in advance about what to expect. During assessment I suggest that the past provides a context to better understand present situations in order to find more effective solutions to current difficulties. I may well say; “If there were easy answers you would have found them…”

It is common for these clients to ask how many sessions will be needed and I usually recommend six then review – avoidant people don’t like to feel trapped. Perhaps because they have chosen to see me ‘despite’ information about how I work, it is rare for them to leave after these first six. However, I have to prove myself useful.

So, during that initial stage I aim to:

    show interest in their present situation while also building a picture of the past
    stimulate their curiosity about themselves – help them develop an ‘observing ego’
    give them ways to think about and make sense of their lives
    explore their resources
    draw attention to their self-critical, demanding, perfectionist tendencies

Next time I will focus on some curious features that I have noticed among many ‘Avoidant’ individuals.

# Working with Avoidant Attachment: Attachment Patterns And The Pandemic 

How might social distancing and social-isolation be affecting clients depending on their attachment patterns? In her fourth blog about working with highly defended clients, Attachment-based psychoanalytic psychotherapist Linda Cundy spots an opportunity for therapists to explore issues around intimacy, need, contamination, intrusion and self-protection. 

Just as I sat down to prepare this blog a text alert popped up from Gov.UK; ‘New rules in force now: you must stay at home’. These are strange and challenging times. A potentially deadly virus, social distancing and self-isolation tap into primitive anxieties for us members of a social species, and attachment needs kick in. Feeling threatened, we often reach out to family, friends, neighbours, even strangers.

This is my fourth blog focusing on ‘Avoidant’ individuals. The current unprecedented restrictions may have a different impact on them. As one client wryly commented: “I’ve been socially distancing and self-isolating all my life”. Such individuals may actually feel relief with the greater distance between themselves and others. Communication with their loved ones may no longer involve physical proximity, and can be turned on and off to suit their needs. They have plentiful skills to manage alone. However, for those who rely on constant activity and busyness to avoid painful feelings and memories, long hours without distraction will be tough.

It is also problematic if a ‘Dismissing’ person is confined in a small space with someone else – unless the other person is equally defended and remote! Sharing space requires negotiation, adaptation, consideration, communication. Most avoidant people are considerate and reasonable, but they also need to retreat from time to time to recover from the demands of interaction that they find depleting. This is even true of psychotherapists!

If a partner (or flatmate) is feeling anxious and needs more connection and reassurance during the Covid-19 outbreak, the avoidant person will experience that as an intrusion into a private space and withdraw, physically or emotionally. The anxious party may then feel abandoned and angry, and up the ante to get the care they need – but this further alienates the avoidant one. In serious situations this pattern can escalate until one partner or the other lashes out. Hopefully (for them), most of the avoidant individuals are able to work from home and can legitimately busy themselves this way to avoid the dreaded intimacy.

The coronavirus… there is a connection between contamination, contagion and avoidant anxieties. Dismissing individuals find close contact invasive; it gets under their skin, infects their private minds. Privacy of mind is precious. There are two reasons, suggesting two different origins for these particular defences.

    If someone gets really close and can see inside me and read my thoughts they would see what a worthless, weak, despicable person I really am. They will despise me as I despise myself. (The likely origin of this fear is an early relationship with a critical, rejecting attachment figure that has been internalised.)
    If someone gets emotionally close to me I am at risk of losing myself, of being suffocated and colonised by their needs. (The likely origin here is an early relationship with a caregiver whose anxieties get inside the baby and prevent him finding any peace.)

This latter point is something I have discovered through a quarter of a century of clinical work. Parental anxiety – and anger – infect the infant like a virus and prevent him from getting to experience himself – his mind, his body, his needs and pleasures. The only way he can find any internal space is initially to close his eyes or turn his head away from the over-stimulation, then to develop a defensive armour that cuts him off from other people.

So the move to online therapy may also be a relief for many of our avoidant clients. It is possible that some feel more relaxed with ‘remote’ or ‘distance’ therapy and may open up more. It will be interesting to know how they cope with returning to therapy ‘in 3D’ once lockdown is over. Some may resist returning to in-person sessions. This situation gives us the opportunity to talk about sharing space, intimacy, need, terror, contamination, intrusion and self-protection, to help these people make connections and grieve for all that they miss out on in order to keep themselves safe.

Next time I will write about my concept of secondary defences. Stay safe and well.

# Working with Avoidant Attachment: Dandelions, Orchids and Secondary Defences

Avoidant personalities come in many different shapes and sizes, and may even be reacting to the coronavirus crisis in quite contrasting ways. In her fifth blog about working with highly defended clients, Attachment-based psychoanalytic psychotherapist Linda Cundy considers the contribution of a person’s sensitivity to their relational environment, and the role of secondary defences. 

The world we have always taken for granted has been shaken up by the coronavirus pandemic. Many put their own lives at risk daily to help others, while some others already seem to have adapted to this new environment. There are ‘avoidant’ individuals in both groups.

One variant of the ‘avoidant personality’ is motivated to work hard, to be driven even to the point of self-harm, sacrificing themselves if need be. What may look like ambition can disguise a sense of unworthiness. The benefits may include status, financial reward, feeling valued by others for what we do (rather than who we feel ourselves to be) and, to some extent, self-respect. I suspect this describes the motivations of many in the medical profession as well as quite a few therapists. Caring for others is a way of atoning for our own perceived inadequacies.

A second variant is the insular, self-contained personality whose relational needs are deeply buried and denied. They are content alone and find the intrusion of other people into their quiet worlds an annoyance. However they fill their time, close contact with other people is avoided.

There are many other ‘types’ of avoidant personality and few people fit neatly into a category. There are many reasons for this, including:

- Having different patterns of attachment with two or more important caregivers in early life: secure, ambivalent, avoidant or disorganised (these are all internalised and modify each other, but when push comes to shove, one tends to dominate – our core pattern)
- Later significant relationships where a person’s beliefs about other people and himself are consistently challenged
-   Events in the family of origin that change the child’s relationship with his attachment figures
    Whether he is a ‘dandelion’ or an ‘orchid’

Dandelions versus orchids

The ‘dandelion / orchid hypothesis’ concerns a child’s sensitivity to his relational environment. ‘Dandelion’ children are the adaptable ones who can cope with life’s challenges pretty well; they toughen up and get on with things while the ‘orchids’ need more specialised care – they need their environment to adapt to them. When that doesn’t happen, they are perhaps more prone to shame and withdrawal. And, as a bit of a gardening buff, I know that orchids come in many varieties from the ones you can buy at the supermarket that cope with some neglect, right through to those that only survive in the branches of specific tree species in the cloud forests of Costa Rica. The human equivalent feels deeply wounded by misattunement, never mind criticism or rejection, and withdraws from close contact with people.

The secondary defence: a case vignette

But I want to mention another pattern I have come across many times in my practice: I refer to it as the secondary defence. Here’s an example:

Tom lives alone and works in IT. He has a relationship with Eloïse, who lives in Paris. They meet up once or twice a month, either in the UK or France, and communicate via social media and occasional phone calls. This arrangement suits them both just fine till Eloïse goes quiet, taking a day or two to respond to Tom’s messages and making excuses to avoid getting together. Tom begins to get angry, then insecure. He tries to lure her back with seductive messages then hints that he’s found someone else. Eloïse blocks him on social media.

Tom starts losing sleep, can’t concentrate on work, finds himself in tears desperate to get her back. He does not recognise himself. He considers asking his GP for antidepressants but instead decides on therapy (online, of course). 

My hypothesis is this (and there is some evidence to support it): early in life, Tom’s mother made him feel special but she often went out, leaving him with a childminder. He protested in every way possible, including being ill, and sometimes his mum changed her mind and stayed home to care for him. But once he was a bit older his protests stopped working. In fact, he would then be left at home alone. No amount of distress changed her mind. Tom had to give up hope of experiencing that special intimacy with her again and hardened himself, shutting down his longing.

And then along comes Eloïse, and their relationship recreates Tom’s with his mother. His secondary defences that have kept people away now break down and he is back to his core of anxious attachment, desperate to get his mother / partner back. And, of course, he despises himself for falling apart.

There is one more significant factor in a person’s core pattern of attachment and that is whether or not they have had a meaningful experience of psychotherapy. I hope I can help the ‘Toms’ and others like him who come to see me.

The next few blogs will focus on how therapy can help avoidant clients.

# Working with Avoidant Attachment: Affect Regulation and Mourning

How can we help avoidant clients to drop their defences and allow deep emotions to emerge? In her sixth blog about working with highly defended clients, Attachment-based psychoanalytic psychotherapist Linda Cundy discusses the centrality of affect regulation and mourning in this work, taking in the role of countertransference, self-compassion and humour, Fairbairn’s ‘moral defence’ and Stern’s ‘moments of meeting’.

In previous blogs I’ve introduced ideas and observations about avoidant / dismissing individuals, their relationships with other people and with themselves – their inner worlds – and how they present in therapy. The next few will focus on the aims of therapy with these clients from an attachment perspective. By definition, an ‘avoidant’ client is insecure, so the overall aim is to help them become more secure. Attachment theory and research have given us an understanding of what needs to change to make this possible, and we need to find ways of working, both face-to-face and online, that facilitate these changes.

Affect regulation:

- Avoidant individuals discover early in life how to numb emotional pain – their emotional spectrum comes in pale hues rather than vibrant, intense shades. They may have invested all their energies in cognitive left-brain development as a compensation for ‘right-brain’ feelings (and been rewarded for being precociously clever and ‘good’ – and for hiding any inconvenient age-appropriate need or distress). Many are almost alexithymic in their relationship with emotions. Therapy needs to help these clients access their feelings, give names and appropriate weight to feeling states (“You tell me you feel irritated but it looks to me like you’re furious;” “You describe feeling unhappy yet I sense you are utterly devastated…”)
- Attunement and countertransference are vital in picking up disavowed feelings. It can be helpful to draw attention to this as a source of information for clients (“I feel my eyes well up with tears when you’re talking about…;” “I notice how my stomach has been churning with you here today and I wonder what it’s trying to tell us about what’s going on under the surface for you…”)
    Keep interventions simple and powerful. It’s important to avoid being too ‘heady’ with complex sentences during moments of heightened affect – that’s colluding with the client’s defences.
- Accessing emotions and the memories that go with them is painful and – to them – shameful, something they have defended against all their lives. Expect resistance and even acting out. The greater the resistance, the greater the distress they are defending against. In fact, you’ll need to have proved yourself useful and developed a strong therapeutic relationship before focusing too intensely on emotions.
    Remember that affect includes enjoyment, playfulness and laughter as well as rage, grief and despair. Humour is a precious resource to connect with ‘dismissing’ clients.
    Clients need to trust their therapists to tolerate and contain intense ‘shameful’ feelings that can eventually erupt and trust they will ‘put them back together’ before they leave sessions.
    Avoidant people often fear being overwhelmed by their emotions once the flood gates are opened, but having access to a full range of feelings – affect states – counters depression, is energising and enlivening. The realisation that they have needed to deny so much of themselves is one route into mourning.

2. Mourning

    Attachment-informed therapy places great emphasis on the process of mourning, grieving for what was precious but was lost, or what was needed for security but was lacking. Avoidant individuals can so easily minimise their distress: “It didn’t affect me;” “others have it worse;” “all parents smacked their kids in those days…”.
    Some are full of consideration for their caregivers; “She did the best she could but there was no-one to support her and she was depressed...”. That may well be true but it is another defence against pain. The child’s need for security was not met and, often, the client blames him- or herself: “I was a difficult kid, always getting into trouble. It must have been hell for my parents to look after me.” Fairbairn called this the ‘moral defence’.
    Therapists need to help their avoidant clients feel some compassion for themselves as children. This is a start to accepting their imperfections as adults.

When an avoidant client can drop his or her defences and allow deep emotions to emerge, we can experience ‘moments of meeting’ (Stern), moments of intimacy and connection that are truly transformational for individuals who have defended against intimacy most of their lives.
