Dear James
 
Thank you for you understanding our considerations. 
We can confirm 30% in advance against a bank guarantee. But, I think that this will not be needed - I really believe that we can find a reasonable period of time for the net 30 terms.
I think that we can be more flexible and agree for net 30 from shipment if your technician will arrive within 7 days of the system arrival. This will give us enough time for our researcher's inspection and acceptance within 30 days from arrival.
Please confirm
Best Regards,

Shy Shuval

"the price would need to rise to cover the cost of a bank guarantee, which is about 5% of the sum guaranteed.
Notice that it is 30% in his text - we asked for 50%. So that is of the order of Â£1,500."

"Bank guarantees represent a more significant contractual obligation for banks than letters of credit do. A bank guarantee, like a letter of credit, guarantees a sum of money to a beneficiary. The bank only pays that amount if the opposing party does not fulfill the obligations outlined by the contract"
