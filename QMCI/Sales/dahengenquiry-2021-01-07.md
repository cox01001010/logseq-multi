# Initial E-mail from [[yi-fanivan-wang]] of [[daheng-new-epoch-technology]]

Dear James:
     Happy new year to you!
     Here is a potential case from my customer from The Aerospace Information Research Institute (AIR) under the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) recently who is interested in purchasing superconducting bolometers.The customer is to doing the relative research on THz near filed system,his labs is on the construction now and to be fully equipped in the end of this year.I just looked through the relative product introduce in your homepage,I think the integrated system including superconducting bolometers and the cryogenic system seems be the right one for my customer,following your introduce and my customer requirement,he cares more about the fast speed and high sensitivity of the detector,so that I think the superconducting bolometers completely with the cryogenic system is a smart choice for my customer.
    However,it's also the first time to involve the superconducting bolometers,so that I am seeking your assistance in both business and technology.In the hand of business,I am wondering if I order the system from you or I need to talk with the others like your reseller or representative in China.In the hand of technology,do you need more further technical information of the requirement to make sure the right product for my customer?If so,pls let me know your questions and I will answer you after I discuss with my customer.
    I hope hear from you soon.
Best regards
Yi-Fan(Ivan) Wang
     
## his specific questions are:

- can he buy direct from us, or should he use our agent
  - [x] check with ken whether [[yi-fanivan-wang]] needs to purchase thru [[zhiwa]]les/zhiwa]] 

-  we need to ensure technical spec is correct 
   -  I need to check what he means by high speed, sensitivity etc...
   - [x] check specs with [[yi-fanivan-wang]] 

### my reply (sent [[2021-01-07]])

Dear Yi-Fan,

Happy new year to you too!

It's good to hear from you, thank you for writing with such an interesting potential customer. 

We do employ an agent for PR China and I can make introductions at a later date. For now I will check the technical requirements of the customer so we are providing the best option.

Our NbTES bolometer system has a system optical NEP of around 2pW/rtHz and a 3dB point of 1kHz. Will that speed be sufficient? We have other faster detectors, but they do not cover the same extent of the THz window. If you tell me the speed, sensitivity and optical frequency range, I can recommend a detector. These detectors can be mounted in traditional "wet" cryostats that use liquid cryogens or turn-key "dry" systems that use closed cycle cooling.

# Reply from [[yi-fanivan-wang]] on [[2021-01-08]]

Dear James:
     Thank you for the quick reply.
     I just discussed with my customer,he thinks the current standard specification of the integrated system shown in your homepage is good for his experiment requirement.But it's also the first time for him to purchase such system,to be better and clear for your recommendation,we make the requirement clear again:
 1.The optical frequency range must be at 0.1-4THz,so that the detector should work at THz window.
 2.The speed is as fast as possible,the sensitivity is as high as possible too.Pls note the requirement for speed and sensitivity could be among the standard product you provide,I think if you provide customized system,the cost may be too high,but if it's not,the customized system is welcome as well.
      As I noticed you had the agent in China,I am open to talk with the agent if necessary,may I know the agent company name?Besides,if the customer choose to apply for tax exemption status for the cargo,is it possible to sign the contract with QMC directly?The purchase mode depends the price of the system.
     I hope hear from you soon.
Best regards
Yi-Fan(Ivan) Wang

## customer requirements and my actions

- optical frequency range 0.1 - 4 4THz
- speed "as fast as possible"
- sensitivity "as high as possible"
- they believe that speed and sensitivity are served by NbTES as defined on our website
- need to pin down what "as fast as possible" means
  - may be better to give list of options
- update [[ray tsang]]
- find out about exemption status - qmci contract directly?
- further consideration comes from follow up email from customer 

# further email from [[yi-fanivan-wang]] [[2021-01-09]]

Dear James:
    As my customer looked through your homepage to find THz low pass filter yesterday,here is a technical question that may I know the damage threshold especially at 800nm of the standard low pass filter(under 18THz)?
     I hope hear from you soon.

- if they are using lasers need to let them know of power handling limits

[[damage limits of filters]]

## my reply 2021-01-11

Thank you for providing further details.

0.1THz to 4THz is fine for the NbTES detector, in fact, it can operate up to 20THz. 

We wouldn’t be providing a custom system to increase the speed, we would be using different detector technology. To cover the required optical frequency we would need to combine two detecting elements. The first, InSb, would cover 0.1THz – ~1.5THz. The second, GeGa, would cover 1.5THz up to ~10THz. 

I have a question arising from your email regarding the damage limits of the low pass filters. Is the customer intending to use high power sources with this detector system? If he is then he should know that the NbTES has a maximum measurable power limit of around 10-20uW (we can go to ~80uW, but you lose sensitivity). 

I shall get back to you regarding contract arrangements and the damage limits of the filters in the next couple of days. Generally, the filters are robust and can with stand mW of power, but I don’t have a definitive failure limit. Does the customer have a value in mind that they would be using?

# further email from [[yi-fanivan-wang]] [[2021-01-12]]

Much appreciated for the reply.
    After I discussed with my customer just now,let me be clear for the system he would like to build up,The source is THz QCL(EasyQCL-1000) from LongWave Photonics,and the detector probably is from QMC complete with cryogenic system,and the other detector is THz camera from I2S he already has.The filter is likely to work with THz camera,so I think the damage threshold don't need as high as what they expect before,as you explained,I think mW level is good.Regarding to the detector type,I think NbTES detector is fine for the application,I don't concern too much for the input power,because the output power of QCL is not too high and he can use the Si window to reduce the extra power if necessary.
    So what we need to do now is waiting for your quotation for superconducting bolometers completely with cryogenic system and low pass filter(under 18THz),to go the further discussion.Hopefully hear from you soon.

## checked with ken regarding quoting

- basically: we send quote (in GBP sterling, ex works) word document is[[zhiwa]]n [[zhiwa]] or [[ags-corporation]] can use it to quote whatever he wants. 
- regarding tax emption - ken doesn't see his point
  - "“As I noticed you had the agent in China,I am open to talk with the agent if necessary,may I know the agent company name?Besides,if the customer choose to apply for tax exemption status for the cargo,is it possible to sign the contract with QMC directly?The purchase mode depends the price of the system.” [[yi-fanivan-wang]]

## my actions

- [x] holding email to [[yi-fanivan-wang]] to explain that zhiwa will be in touch with a quote
  - [x] check if 18 THz LPE is separate to detector
  - [x] explain cone differences?
  - [x] ask about filter choice, asking for 18THz but QCL is <5THz
- [x] email ray to update
- [>] write quote - opportunity for new style 
- [>] consider opportunity for commissioning / sales trip (almost certainly impossible)
- [>] check out [THz QCL(EasyQCL-1000) from LongWave Photonics](https://longwavephotonics.com/uploads/3/5/6/2/35623417/easyqcl-1000_turnkey_thz_source_v1.1.pdf)
  
# further email from [[yi-fanivan-wang]] 

Dear James:
    Thank you for the thoughtful reply about the filter's choice.
    I fully understand your question why they choose the filter under 18THz if the customer use QCL as the source,it may confuse you by what I don't fully introduce the research of the customer.The labs is focusing on THz imaging especially THz near filed imaging,the labs is started up in the middle of last year and my customer ordered two Ti:S fs amplifiers from Spectral Physics,one STM system from Germany and one SNOM system from Germany.The QCL from Longwave and the superconducting bolometers completely with cryogenic system from QMC are on the way to estimate and plan currently,I am working with the customer closely to propose the relative device and instrument  may be necessary and helpful for his on going and further application.So that's why he choose the filter under 18THz,I think he may use the filter in different system,probably in Air Photonics THz Time Domain system,such system will be with a wide bandwidth as you know clearly,especially much easier to build up such system when you have a stable and robust fs amplifier.
     Once you provide the quotation,I am going to follow and propose the customer as possible as I can.I will also work closely with you and your partner to achieve the order.
Best regards
Yi-Fan(Ivan) Wang

# email from [[ray-tsang]] [[2021-01-21]] regarding commissioning

he asks whether we need to quote for on-site commissioning, etc...

Hello James,

I see  your below e-mail.  I have some questions, please help to answer.

1.  Does this system require on-site commissioning ?
2.  Does the price include the on-site commissioning ?    If not, please quote me the price for on-site commissioning ?
3.  How many days are needed ?
4.  Does the price include operation manual ?  Can the customer easy to use the system by following the operation manual ?

Your prompt reply is appreciated.

## my reply

This price does not include on-site commissioning. These pulse tube systems are easier to operate than traditional wet systems once they are installed. Installation is a bit more involved but should be standard for the end user’s establishment. Manuals are provided that will instruct on installation and I can support remotely using zoom (or whatever is preferred). This is all included in the quoted price. Ongoing support is always offered on our products – we want our customers to get the most out of our detectors.

I would ordinarily quote and offer on-site commissioning as an opportunity to visit the customer and perhaps visit other potential customers. We are not currently quoting for commissioning because we do not want to be in a position where we cannot travel, so cannot commission and therefore cannot get paid.

However, I really want to start getting the pulse tube systems, esp. NbTES, into China and I see this as a good opportunity to start doing that. So, please do not offer commissioning, but if during your discussions with the customer it feels like they really want that as a service and will not buy without it, offer it as £3,000.00 for two days.

Commissioning needs to be a separate contract and it needs some COVID protection in case we have to cancel or our travel costs increase dramatically.

### Ray's reply

Hello James,

Noted.   I will persuade the customer not to have commissioning.   Thank you.

  
Best regards

# update from [[ray-tsang]] [[2021-02-03]] 

I spoke to Yi-Fan.   The current situation is :  The funding is ready currently.   The end-user is going to purchase several instruments such as Ti:S amplifier. The procurement started in the mid of last year.    There is a good chance we can sell QMC’s Bolometer to the end-user.   The end-user plans to first trying to apply for tax free permit to purchase QMC’s Bolometer.    This year is the beginning of another five years-plan, so the policy of tax exemption is not released yet, which delay the procurement of foreign brand’s product.     The tax-exemption policy shall be released in March to June.    If so, the purchasing process shall start soon in June.    It may need to go through tender.   So, the whole procurement process takes time.

I will contact Yi-Fan in March to get more updates.   Thank you.

Best regards
