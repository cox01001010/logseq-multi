[[2021-02-15]] customer is interested in bandpasses:

## Customer Request [[2021-02-17]]
           
“

Thank you for your detailed information.

During the last month, we have discussed this topic and concluded that it is necessary for six filters with a central frequency of 0.1, 0.15, 0.2, 0.3, 0.5, and 1 THz to retrieve a temporal distribution from the spectral measurement.

Then we need non-standard products if it is not too expensive. Please let me know the indicative price for these.

In addition to the bandwidth information, could you tell me the extinction ratio of the filters?

Best regards

it's likely we can do something here, combining a couple of standard filters with others to keep the overall cost down.  
  
The charge this year for a single standard filter in a mount this size is £1,375, and we can suggest the 0.35 and 0.65 THz standards as part of the collection if they are not too choosy about the centre frequencies.  
For non-standard filters the one-off price is usually at least £2,750 even for a small one but we can give a discount for purchasing larger numbers.  
  
So if we offered 4 non-standard (£2,750 each) and two standard (£1,375 each) that's £13,750 but if they agreed to buy 6 I'd knock that down to about £10k or £11k.  
  
We can show examples like these, though more modern examples would be better if you have access to them from the job files (Carole won;t be available for the next 2 weeks to help.)  
  
So go for it !  
Cheers

questions that arise from this are: why do we offer discounts for multiple purchaseson [[filters]]? I don't see that they need to be incentivised, people generally either need or dont need - maybe its because they dont have infinite money and need help buying lots of things. i dont know how much things cost to make, but also, not all filters require the same amount of effort.

Dear Ji-Gwang,

We currently charge at least £2,750.00 for non-standard filters and £1,575.00 for standard band pass filters. To keep costs down, we propose providing 0.35 and 0.65 as standard filters and then four non-standards to complete the set. We can also provide discounts for larger orders so if six were purchased, we could offer these for a total price of £11,000.

I’ve included some example plots of similar band ranges with the expected performance below.

If you would like to proceed I can offer a quote for you to raise an order against. If you have any further questions, please don’t hesitate to get back in touch.

With best regards,

James
