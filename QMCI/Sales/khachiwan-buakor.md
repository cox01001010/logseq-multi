To whom it may concern, 

My name is Khachiwan Buakor from Chiang mai university, Thailand. 
We are interested in the Winton cone products.  It would be used for 
collecting the THz radiation in our laboratory. I have read the information 
on the website (http://www.qmcinstruments.co.uk/winston-cones). I am
interested in the standard size cone with the focal ratio f/2 (entrance 
aperture 23.8 mm, exit aperture 5.5 mm and length 41.4 mm). 

Could you please send me more information about this product (price, etc.)? 
Thank you very much.

Best regards,
Khachiwan

#### my reply 

Dear Khachiwan,

Thank you very much for your enquiry regarding our f/2 Winston cones.

These cones are highly efficient at concentrating light onto our family of Terahertz detectors and work best by placing the detector close to the exit of the cone. You can see from the photos on the webpage you linked to that there are interface flanges at the rear of the cone that enable them to be attached to our standard detector block. Efficiency is maximised by placing the detector into an integrating cavity offering the photons multiple passes for detection. 

Do you have an existing detector block design that you would wish to use or do you have some other application in mind? 

To make sure we provide the correct product to you it would be helpful to know a little about your experimental setup. What are you collecting the THz radiation on to? What is the f/number of the incoming radiation?   

With best regards,
James

Dear James,

Thank you very much for you email. We only plan using it for intensity measurement to
confirm that our transition radiation is terahertz. The radiation will pass through the 
HDPE window after being reflected by a parabolic mirror, so it should be parallel.
The beamsize will be around 22 mm at the window from the simulation.
the radiation is collected by a cone to the Pyroelectric detector, where the FOV
is 6 mm. The detector block design is still being worked on.

Best regards,
Khachiwan

Dear Khachiwan, 

Thank you for taking the time to explain your setup to me.

We can accommodate your 22mm beam size and I attach two example drawings. The larger cone costs £1800 and the smaller one slightly less.

I would like to draw your attention to the exit aperture of the cone, which is 5.5mm. To maximise coupling efficiency the detecting area should be closely matched to this aperture. Your pyro has a field of view of 6mm – what is the detecting area, how far back will it sit from the exit aperture of the cone?

We can work with you to design an interface flange that would work with your block, or I can provide the standard flange design for you to work to. Which would you prefer?

I don’t know whether you have the pyroelectric detector already, but we also provide fully integrated pyroelectric detector units. These come with Winston cone, filter and readout electronics all supplied http://www.qmcinstruments.co.uk/pyroelectric-detectors. These units are calibrated optically and come with a two year guarantee and costs £7500. Do let me know if this is of interest to you.

If I can provide more information, please let me know.

With best regards,
James
