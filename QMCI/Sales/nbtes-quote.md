# NbTES Quote

- I like the cleanness and simplicity of oxford instrumets quotes.
  - quote is at the front, specs and terms follows
  - will probably copy this style
  - ken's is great, but personally, I find it too verbose, especially for foreign countries
  - all most people want are the numbers and some words
  - also check what was written for BNL readout, this is obv how rashmi thinks it should be done

 In response to your recent enquiry I am pleased to confirm the following prices for superconducting THz bolometer systems.

 
Cryo-free THz Bolometer System


We first describe our detector and component technology then discuss how these can be incorporated into fully operational systems as pictured above
 
## Cooled Detector………Superconducting Niobium TES Bolometer

The Niobium superconducting bolometer type QNbB/X is a very recent development on offer for the first time commercially in September 2012. It improves significantly on crucial aspects of the performance of traditional broadband semiconductor based bolometers in Germanium and Silicon, which we now no longer offer.  

This new detector technology offers excellent sensitivity with a low operating impedance to reduce susceptibility to microphonic noise and electromagnetic interference.  Noise reduction is assisted by novel noise cancellation techniques in the detector bias and amplification circuitry so that the detector gives identical performance in both liquid helium reservoir and electrical (pulse tube) cooling platforms. 

The 1/f noise component in this superconducting thermistor is greatly reduced, whilst speed of detection is increased, so that the range of modulation frequencies at which the detector operates near optimum sensitivity is significantly increased.

The thin film Niobium thermistor is photolithographically deposited onto a SiN substrate along with a thin metal absorbing film and electrical contacts. The thermistor is in good thermal contact with the metal absorber which changes temperature as it absorbs THz power. The SiN substrate provides excellent thermal isolation of the active parts of the detector.
 
The operation of a superconducting thermistor on its transition edge permits the use of electro-thermal feedback to stabilize the device. A direct consequence of this scheme is a major improvement by orders of magnitude compared to the linear dynamic range available from semiconductor based cooled detectors.

The bolometer has essentially constant spectral responsivity from 90GHz through the THz region and into the near infra-red. In practice (unless available funds can allow the use of large diameter CVD diamond as a vacuum window) its spectral range is limited by the transmission properties of vacuum window materials. Our unique multi-layer mesh filters are included in these systems to ensure that any unwanted frequencies are rejected to a high level and that sensitivity is optimized for the particular circumstances of the experiment to hand.

## System integration and design

The bolometer described above is incorporated into a fully functional detector system within an electrically powered pulse tube cooler as described below.

QMC Instruments Ltd. offers a full system design and assembly service. Systems are offered with full calibration and guarantee as detailed below. Note that System Optical NEP figures will be higher (worse) than the detector optical NEP values quoted above because system figures include transmission losses of the requisite optical components (filters and vacuum windows) and also any optical coupling losses. System noise values include preamplifier noise contributions. For these reasons system NEP figures are usually about a factor of 2 higher than the quoted detector optical NEP.

It is particularly of note that electrical NEP parameters should not be confused with optical NEP. All QMC Instruments detectors and systems come with a full calibration of all optical, electrical and cryogenic performance parameters, which we guarantee. You will also receive a full colour instruction manual containing detailed descriptions of the recommended operation procedures.


## Detector System Components

###	Pulse tube coolers

QMC Instruments Ltd. is the first to offer commercial THz broadband bolometer systems configured in a cooled environment which requires no liquid cryogens. Continuous operation is possible wherever there is a standard (single phase) mains power supply. In the following example the cooling platform comprises a Cryomech pulse-tube cooler with remote motor and air-cooled compressor. A technical summary follows:

The cooling platform for the detector comprises a pulse-tube refrigerator with a compressor which may be cooled by air or by water. The technical specification for the system is as follows:

* We prefer when possible to ship the compressor under separate cover directly from Cryomech. This saves on shipping costs. In this case the weights and dimensions will change. The figures quoted assume that the whole system is shipped as a single entity.

###  Frequency selection (multi-mesh filters)

Cryogenic efficiency and out-of-band rejection is achieved using our unique multi-mesh filter technology. The filters accurately define and limit the observed band so that no unwanted radiation penetrates either to the 4K stage of the cooling platform or to the detector. In this way detector performance is optimized. Appended to this quotation are two figures demonstrating the measured performance of our standard filters. 
Standard low-pass filters are included in all our detector systems.

 


###  Signal Read-out

 Our TES detector systems are supplied with a low-noise amplifier and read-out unit which mounts directly to the side of the cooling platform as shown in the front page photograph of this document. Unlike conventional TES readout systems, our amplifier design does not use cold SQUID amplifiers and is therefore highly immune to external magnetic fields. Furthermore, our unique biasing system ensures unsurpassed detector linearity over a very wide dynamic range. The detector operating conditions are set to optimum values during our factory calibration routine prior to shipment. The end user need only apply power to the unit – no further tuning is required and the ideal operating conditions will not vary with time or illumination conditions. 

Two voltage output signals are provided on BNC connectors, each signal directly proportional to absorbed optical power: 

i)	DC Output: This unconditioned output provides a DC voltage signal. This output will feed an output load RL ≥ 1KOhm;
ii)	AC Output: This is low-pass filtered at 5 kHz with a two-pole electronic filter and provides user selectable additional gain compared to the DC Output. This output will feed an output load RL ≥ 1KOhm;

Note: All gains and band-passes can be tuned to match the data acquisition system.

Our TES amplifier electronics can be powered by a single power supply in the range 5V - 9V DC @ 1Amp. As standard we supply a mains USB power adaptor. The user can also run the amplifier with a USB battery (not supplied) if desired.
