		- Fwd: Purchase of a cryogenic material test bench.
			- Hi Ken,
			  You have misunderstood.  Paul is refering to the system that we are commissioning for the ESA-ARC project.  We (PCH, CDo and myself) designed it around a GM cryocooler from Simitomo.  Specifically this system is for larger diameter samples 50mm clear aperture which can then be place in a collimated VNA beam.  Only one sample is measured at a time and it uses a manual operated slider mechanism. Temperature control for the sample is via LabView PID.  It was this system that I was working on when Paul visited.  Much of the egineering was out-sourced but the tricky internal bits were done by Julian and Chris.
			  The first trials in anger will start this week following several weeks of tweaking the system.

			- well yes, that's great, but
			- (i) it's a loose definition of "recently."
			  (ii) I recall that Julian complained about the design of the sample wheel mechanism. So it's a complete re-design !
			- Happy for you to arrange a telecon with Paul. I'm in Wed/Thu/Fri this week.
			- Cheers

			- Hi Peter,
			- Was good to see you last month.
			- I have just been informed that we have additional budget this year for our lab to procure a 'Cryogenic Sample test bench'.
			  This was envisaged to be way to measure materials down to 4k over 50- 1200GHz
			- Given you have recently built  such a setup, I was wondering if you/ QMC would be willing to sell a similar system to us?
			- If this is something you are interested in, can we organise a telecom to discuss further?
			- Thanks 
			  Paul
