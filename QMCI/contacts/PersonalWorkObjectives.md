I've stalled a bit since December 2019, need to get back on track.

## [[sales]]

 - want a database of everything sold in the last 10 years including customers, items, contacts
 - greater sales in china, before they move beyond us
 - develop a strategy for partnering with bruker, poss in china too
 - masa will not go on for ever - make contact with other agents chase uses
 
 
 ## [[Development]]

tied with increasing sales and presence of our current offering, we need to push our development. high frequency (nearing optical) for synchrotons are a good start, but we need new, better, faster detectors

- TiNi?
- NbNi
- Al
- Faster pyro
- Cooling platforms

## [[AdministrativeTasks]]

- databases of cryomech
- databases of systems
- databases of customers
