Subject: Question about NTD GE bolometer

Dear James,

It's been a while since I've seen you.

I hope you are doing well under this severe COVID situation.

I have a question about our NTD Ge bolometer.

Currently, it has a 360 GHz LPF built in, and the manual states that it is sensitive from 66 GHz to 360 GHz.

If the LPF is removed, how high frequency is it sensitive to? 

Best regards,

Kodo

Dear Kodo,

It’s good to hear from you! I can’t believe it’s almost two years since I visited you – in normal circumstances I would try and get out and see you, but now, who knows when we’ll be able to travel freely again?

I am doing well, thank you. We are in our 3rd lockdown now, but with vaccines being deployed fairly rapidly, we are hopeful this is the last one with such severe restrictions. We are still allowed to work this time – the university shut from March until July last year, but is still open currently.

I hope you are doing well in Nagoya. I saw that Tokyo had restrictions recently but don’t know whether they extended to Nagoya? Are you able to still attend the lab?

To answer your question directly, there is a further LPE filter on the 1K shield that has an edge at 21 cm-1 (630 GHz). If you remove the filter on the cone, it will “see” to 630 GHz, BUT, sensitivity will be lost – maybe by as much as an order of magnitude, possibly two. Because the detector is background limited, we have to reduce the background to get the femtoWatt sensitivity.

The absorbing material the NTD Ge element is mounted on is responsive to a broad band of frequencies. This means we can limit the band using bandpasses and edges to pick the region you are interested in.

So, depending on your requirements, I would suggest replacing the LPE filter with a bandpass filter.

What frequency were you hoping to detect?

Generally, how has the system performed for you? If you could make changes to the system, what would they be?

I hope you and your group are all faring well.

With best regards,

James

Dear James,

  
Thank you very much for your kind reply.

Nagoya University has been partially closed. Research activities have been slowed down for the past year. The rule is that students may or may not come to the lab.

Thank you for the information about the detector. The reason I asked about the bandwidth is because Mr. Sugiura needed to include it in his master's thesis. For the time being, we will use the current one.

Your detector is performing wonderfully, being able to spectrate millimeter waves as faint as 0.1 femto watt!!

I look forward to the day when the corona disaster is over and we can meet again.

Best regards,

Kodo
