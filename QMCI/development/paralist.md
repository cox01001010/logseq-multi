Peter leaves, prob in Autumn 2021.

would like to work on the following

GeGa
Al TES 
NbNi
TiNi
Nb TES 
FTS

he seems to be interested in finishing his filter temperature gradient measurments 

## Continuous Cycle 4He for FTS measurements

Hi James,

See below and attached reports.  From these it appears we could use the IPS system to run TES/Bolometric detectors near 1K or ask SC to provide a dedicated 1K system with better performance.  Such solutions are attractive to us to eliminate the need for liquid He4 and to provide a testbed for low NEP TES detectors made from TiNi.  We would need to implement PID control of the detector temperature but that is not a problem.

Converting the IPS system to a detector system seems the cheapest way to proceed to demonstrate the value of such a system and to advance the development of lower NEP TES devices.

We should discuss.
