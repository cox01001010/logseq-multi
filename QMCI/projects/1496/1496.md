At present, after proper evacuation and cooling to Liq. He of the Dewar, I fail to get response from the detector. Is there an electrical test I can run from the outside on the power and preamp unit to check that the connections are OK? that the unit reaches adequate temperature? Or any test to verify that the unit is operational?

## observations before replying

- I don't know what Vh, Vouputoffset, or Vsetpoint are supposed to be - set by rashmi - i only calibrated - second system to [[1373]] [[tolouse]]

## my response [[2021-01-08]]

Dear Laurent,

I remember this system well - my colleague Adam and I commissioned it for Marie Labat in the summer of 2013.

I'm sorry to hear that you are not getting a signal, hopefully we can get you operational again quickly.

We can check to see if the detector is cold by measuring how much power is needed to hold the superconducting element on transition. This measurement needs to be made with the system cooled to liquid helium temperature as outlined in your operating manual.

Once the detector is cold can you please measure the DC voltage levels at the readout box as shown in the attached photograph. It will be easiest for you if you use the sma connectors that connect to the BNC connectors on the outer box.

With these numbers we will have a better understanding of what is causing the fault.

With thanks and best regards,
James

## Laurent's reply
Thank very much for your quick answer. Yes, Marie Labat’s project being now terminated, I am trying to recycle this detector for another scientific project but in a different configuration.
I join the pictures of the test you propose. Measured on test pointA on your picture, the DC voltage is 6.07V. on the DC output (B on your picture), the DC level is 2.9 mV mean value, but it is really not a DC voltage : it has 20mV peak to peak amplitude with about 65 MHz frequency.

### my calculations

from image of amplifier ![](2021-01-08-13-50-54%201.png) I can see that bias circuit as follows:

Heater: R1 = 1000; R2 = 22; R3 = 0; Rh = 27.1
bias: R1 = 1000; R2 = 182; R3 = 10000

will ask Laurent to twiddle knobs ![](2021-01-08-14-39-31%201.png)

### my reply

Thank you for making these measurements. The mV level on point B tells us that the no heat is being applied to the detector chip. If we adjust the readout we can see if we are able to bring the device onto transition.

Keep the readout connected to the cryostat and remove the lid of the inner box. I have attached a photograph which labels the potentiometers and monitoring points. Note that the small separate PCB may not be securely fastened so please be careful with it.

Can you please do the following:

-	without adjusting the setting, please measure the bias voltage and tell me what it is
-	without adjusting the setting, please measure the TES Setpoint Voltage and tell me what it is
-	while monitoring the Voltage from Test Point B (currently ~mV and blue on your oscilloscope trace)
o	slowly turn the TES Setpoint Adjustment Potentiometer in a clockwise direction UNTIL the voltage from Test Point B reaches between 1.5V and 1.8V 
(the exact value is not vital right now, so long as it is greater than 1.0V and less than 2.0V)
o	IF the voltage does not increase before you reach the end of the potentiometer, turn the potentiometer in an anticlockwise direction UNTIL the voltage from Test Point B reaches between 1.5 and 1.8
-	When you are finished, please tell me the DC voltages you measure on Test Points A and B 

It may be that you don’t reach ~1.5V by turning the potentiometer in either direction. In that case, can you please tell me the maximum Voltage you are able to reach together with the Voltage measurement of Test Point A at that point.

## laurent's reply ALL FIXED now

"as soon as I began touching the screws of the inner box, the signal started fluctuating wildly..After touching the lid gently things are now very different : on test point, I now get 4.06V and the AC output now responds when I wave my hand in front of the dewar window...so it seems to function (I don't know yet how normally) and I suspect a loose connection problem.
Do you think I should go on with the tests you suggest?"

and

"No the signal now stays at the AC output and it seems quite good!...I don't know though if it will stay if the detector is moved...I will try gentle motions. 
No, I the electronic boxes were still on the system when I started working. It was in the state that Ms Labat left it. The inner part I did changed its position though to accomodate a special optics and I put a diamond window as well. But it seems to me that the contact problem must be within the inner electronic or its connection to the Dewar. I will try pushing it firmly against the Dewar...
Anyway, I am quite relieved...
Thanks and regards"
