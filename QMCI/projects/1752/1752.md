Dear Ken,

RRCAT has been asking questions about the magnetic sensitivity of the TES detector and I would appreciate if you could advise us on the following things.

1.  The performance of TES deteriorates with increasing magnetic field and the detector signal becomes negligible once the magnetic field in their magneto-optical cryostat reaches 5 T. They are not sure whether the signal is being affected by the stray magnetic field from their cryostat. According to Oxford, the stray magnetic field should be around 100 Gauss at the location of the TES.
2.  Another issue they are having is with the detector ranges. HEB provides data until 65 cm-1 and TES is not providing them with good data below 100 cm-1.Â  The observed power below 100 cm-1 is low with gold mirror and it might be even lower when they are measuring the samples. They are looking to address the issue with the gap in their data between 60 and 100 cm-1.
3.  They have mentioned that recently they started to see some spurious noise with TES and are trying to identify the source. They wants us to suggest some ideas on identifying the origin of this TES detector noise.

Thanks and best regards,  
Sudhakar

Hi Sudhakar,  
  
1.  
I do not believe that a 100 Gauss stray field is strong enough to have any noticeable effect on the detector system or the amplifier.  
Are they measuring at a frequency that is then tuned out of frequency range by the B-field?  
It would be instructive to measure zero signal output noise spectra at frequencies up to, say, 10 kHz to see if they are seeing excess noise when the magnet field is increased.  
  
2.  
The low frequency response of the TES channel will be limited by the exit aperture of the Winston cone. In this case it is either an f/3 or f/4 design with 2.2mm and 1.0mm diameter exit apertures respectively.  
In either case we know these systems are good down to 10 or 10 cm-1 before any variation in optical throughput is seen. I would suggest that a roll-off at 100cm-1 is caused by another issue, such as misalignment.  
The System Optical NEPs of the two detector channels are similar, but the responsivity values very different. They should need to use different values of gain after the detector preamplifier, so it would be good to know what other gain values they use in each case.  
  
3.  
It's impossible to diagnose unless they show us examples. I would recommend that they check that the connectors inside the preamplifier box are secure. There is certainly nothing inside the detector they could self-correct. I can report that we have no past experience of "spurious noise" issues with these systems. They have always either worked perfectly or not at all. Can they describe or demonstrate the problem ?  
  
I hope you are all well and happy.  
Cheers  
  
Ken

Hi Ken,

RRCAT has measured zero signal noise (attached) in the presence of stray magnetic fields near the TES detector flange. I am waiting to get more details from them on how these measurements were made and the units for the data.

The TES detector might be going offline when the magnetic field inside their magneto-optical cryostat is increased to 5 T and the detector behaves normally when the field is below 5 T. Do you think of any issues that can damage the detector system at fields higher than 5 T?

I am also attaching the plot of the stray magnetic field vs the MOC magnetic field.

Thanks and best regards,  
Sudhakar

- tyrone says XBI field can vary between 0.3 and 1 Tesla at the detector
- 1T = 10 kG
- sudhakar says 200 Gauss on detector
