meeting with bluesky regarding problems with dual channel system installed on rrcat [[1752]]

# summary of problems:

1. Performance of TES deteriorates with increasing magnetic field
2. Poor spectral performance below 100cm-1


# setup 

QMCI detector installed on blue sky FTS which has interface with oxford magneto-optical cryostat (MOC). 

- system designed for installation on reflection and transmission port
- MOC sits between these two ports

# magnetic field problem

- seen when field in MOC > 5T (1T=10kG)
- measured stray field at 5T at both ports
	- 210G at transmission port
	- 100G at reflection port
- measured effect same at both ports?


questions:

same at both ports?
interferogram at 5T seems high voltage? how compare 
no spectrum at 5T 
overloading detector, not switching off?
maybe not, noise measurement shows marked drop when >200G measured at transmission port

diagnostics: heater power as a function of magnetic field
can turn down feedback on block
dc heater is 2nd from top as looking at amp. assumes fischer is at top
