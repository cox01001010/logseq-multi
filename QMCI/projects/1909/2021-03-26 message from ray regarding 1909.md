There is a problem in the vacuuming process, please give us some suggestions.

The operation process is as follows:

1\. System pumped out to about 2e-3 Pa (within 3 hours by mechanical pump + molecular pump);

2\. Molecular pump automatically stops working;

3\. Reopen the base plate(not open 77K&4K base plate), wipe off the vacuum grease applied before with absolute ethanol and blow the wall of the tank with dry compressed air for about 10 minutes;

4\. Reinstall the base plate (no vacuum grease applied);

5\. Vacuum by mechanical pump and molecular pump.

And the system pumped out to about 2e-3 Pa within 3 hours, but the molecular pump automatically stops working again. It is sure that the molecular pump is not broken, so can you help to determine what might be a problem with the cryogenic?
```

1 Pa = 0.01 mbar so 
1mbar = 100 Pa
2 e-3 Pa = 0.2 mbar - which is not good enough. I would expect e-2mbar on the roughing pump alone in say an hour

Hello Ray,

Because I am unfamiliar with the pump and setup of the customer I have to suggest a test to confirm that the pump does work satisfactorily. This will likely be frustrating to the customer especially as they explicitly say that the pump is not broken. We also need to confirm that they are following good vacuum procedure. It sounds like they are being very thorough, but there are several possible problems:

1.  Inadequate pumping power;
2.  The pump is configured so that the molecular pump comes on too soon, before the mechanical pump has removed all of the water;
3.  Leaks on the pumping lines / connections;
4.  Incorrectly positioned gauge;
5.  Cryostat leak

and we must rule out 1-4 before we begin trouble shooting 5.

If possible, can they describe, or photograph their pump and lines connecting to the cryostat?

I would like to know:

1.  How long is the line between the pump and the cryostat?
2.  Where is the gauge positioned?
3.  What type of pump do they have?

Can they also tell me how the pump works. Does the molecular pump come on automatically, or does it require the user to turn it on? At what pressure does it engage? I donâ€™t turn on the turbo until the pressure is below 2e-1 mBar which enables all of the water to be pumped out of the system.

To test their system can they please pump on the line with the valve to the cryostat closed to see what pressure they achieve?

Does the customer have access to a helium leak checker?

I hope this helps, do get in touch if I have been unclear in any way.

With best regards,

James
