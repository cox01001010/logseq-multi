[[rashmi]] has produced digital readout electronics
he and [[para]] have made spectral measurements

i need to make S:N measurements and speed of response measurements at two operating points:

1. noise optimised (V_BH = -2.75V) (note polarity issue indicitave of diode error on pcb)
2. V_BH = 0V i.e. max dynamic range

### measurement at point 1

#### settings

V_BH = -2.75V
TES_Heater = 1.7 (manual)
TES_Heater = 5.4695V
Power = 11.9uW

PID on

ki = 0.005
Vset = 1
analog monitor o/p gain = 0.5
ADC read delay (ticks) = 181
Heater R1 = 31; R2 = 1800; R3 = 51; Rcable = 21

10k Samples 51.2kHz rate

1) noise floor = 6.5 e-12 W lots of 50Hz, peak at 1600Hz
2) TESH = 15.15V power = 90.9uW noise floor = 5e-11W peak at 1750Hz


##### signal

d2 = 40mm
d1 = 54mm
dt = 94mm

| 80 $\mu$m  | 1.19e-08          | 1.93e-9         | 7.81e-9         |
| 850 $\mu$m | 1.108e-11         | 1.2e-10         | nil             |
| 215 $\mu$m |                   | 2.9e-9          | nil             |
| 25 $\mu    |                   | 2.81e-9         | 3.3e-8          |



##### Speed of response table
