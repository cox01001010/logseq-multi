- thick thermal [[filters]] can contract by as much as 100um from RT to 4K
  - clamping is complex for big stacks to maintain tightness, incorporate spring
  - need breathing holes, along flat and along
- fridge straps are tricky
- cryostat mounting to frame is flawed
  - designed to old design (Gissupe)
    - possibilty of bar to be used, mount on baseplate, possibility of middle ring but not bottom ring 
      - rome need to confirm desires
        - want to use carbon fibres

	- 1st stage not 	
		- short length

	- tyrones new design
		- peek/nylon
		- spring by belville washers
		- roller bearing at warm end
		- how can we test these?
			- bucket ring that mounts on inside of ovc?

- straps / braid
- same for fridge

## meeting with rome [[2021-01-28]]

tables,
technical drawings
blueprints,
FEM
- maintanence - sorb pump expulsion? annually?

## internal design [[2021-02-05]]

### manufacturing

tk can't do it

wec - 2 options 

1.	single piece
	a.	5-7weeks
	b.	5-8k for large ovc
	c.	other ones 5k per smaller
	d.	top hats 2-3k
2.	rolling, welding
	a.	half the costs
	b.	over 10 weeks

go for route 1.


### tweaks to ovc by cw

reduce number of parts of top hat structure

### straps

how to curtain?

### support pins

how to test?

### email from elia

1960: respond to elias's email regarding thermometry

## meeting with rome [[2021-02-10]]
### output from cdr

- cdr team want design drawings for security - also, nda will be issued 
	- if nda, ok with ken

- need assembly document / drawing package
	- is that reasonable? ken
	- elia has page 1,2,3 for document
### labview
-	in control room 500m away at ground level 
	-	use ethernet
	-	mildly prefer linux, but not essential
	-	executable is preferable
	-	[[QMCI/projects/1960/1960]] check if can compile for linux
	-	1960 rashmi electronics check

Meeting ID: 881 9020 1384  
Passcode: S76GDq


### my questions
1. quotes ![[1960_QuotationQuestions_2020-02-16]]

- brian happy with what [[prv]] did for [[sequestim]] 
	
3. anysys simulation
4. drawing checks before manufacturing
5. tc specs
6. frame
7. transit/installation plans
8. 


[[sequestim]] is not cold
	- excess 500mW on 1st stage - Al shield, giving delta T on shield 
	- 4K stage is at 5.2K 
	- cant cycle fridge 
	- find out about MLI in [[sequestim]]

why is 1st stage plate aluminium?


## meeting with rome [[2021-04-28]]

25GHz preferable, 20GHz is OK though
