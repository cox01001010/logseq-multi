Hello Simon, Lee,

We have received the cryocooler and the data files - thank you very much for delivering so quickly.

We have some questions to make sure that we use the cooler correctly and are specifically interested in the best use of the 3He intermediate head (IHe).

To remind you, this system is being built for installation on the Sardinia Radio Telescope and uses the customer's own Kinetic Inductance Detectors.

We are intending to have a mechanical structure that is cooled by the 4He head (buffer stage) to around 1K. This stage is mounted off the 4K cold plate and includes a thermal shield and allows cooling of the detector co-ax.

Off of this 1K stage we directly mount the detector stage which is connected to the Ultra head. We expect the thermal load onto the detector stage from the stainless steel legs and co-ax cables to amount to between 3uW and 4uW. This is being put directly on the Ultra head.

We currently do not have anything being being directly cooled by the 3He intermediate head, and were wondering whether we would be better off mounting and cooling an intermediate support structure that the detector stage is in turn mounted off. This would minimise the load that is being applied to the Ultra head. 

We hope you are all keeping well and thanks for your help with this.
