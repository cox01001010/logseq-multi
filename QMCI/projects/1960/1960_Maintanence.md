## General Schedule

          

I’m very sorry to have missed your message!

1.  The maintenance interval for the pulse tube is every 20,000 hours of continuous use, and consists of swapping out the valve unit for a reconditioned one, and purging the gas within the cold head. This can be done on-site with the pulse tube in place.

c. The compressor’s maintenance interval is every 30,000 hours, and consists of changing the internal oil adsorber. This is a very simple procedure which our customers typically perform themselves.

d. The buffer tank as far as I’m aware does not have specific service requirements but would be purged along with the gas lines etc. during the standard pulse tube gas purging process.

Good afternoon James,

Thank you for your enquiry.  Please allow me to add to Will’s response below as follows.

We provide all tools required for the service activity.  These would consist of 2 x 100L tool kits.

The items we would request to be provided at the time of the valve unit exchange service would be as follows:

-   ~10L cylinder of helium gas, 99.999% purity, 100 bar minimum pressure
-   Vacuum pump capable of ~5m3/hr

Time to complete the service would be approximately 2 hours.

I hope that the above information is helpful and answers your questions.  Should you require any further assistance related to service matters, then please do not hesitate to contact either myself or our Service Administrator, Lynn Hopper, who would be pleased to provide any necessary assistance.

Many thanks and best regards
