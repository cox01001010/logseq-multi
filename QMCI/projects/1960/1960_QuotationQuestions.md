1. were PRV given the same pdf drawings as wec?
2. why no quote for 1960_022B?
3. was 1960_023 broken down for PRV like WEC?          
4. is the difference between them really £36,908.62 - £13,467.00  = £23,441.62 or have I missed something fundamental?
5. do we care that PRV quote is dated July 2019?

           

Hi James

1.  They were both given identical drawings,
2.  I believe that since 22B is welded onto 22a that they just have combined them.
3.  WEC split them up due to them wanting to put the whole thing on a lathe then weld the flange on at the end. PRV are just rolling and welding so have kept it as one unit.
4.  WEC were quoting us for fully machined parts i.e. take a large bar and machine it all away which will be alot more expensive. They felt that this method was preferable to ensure that the system would be fully concentric, highly accurate in tolerance and 100% leak tight by reducing the need for welds which in their view are a risk to the integrity of the vacuum. The difference in price if WEC were rolling and welding would be half the price for each of the cans except stage 4 and 5 which they would still want to machine. This would bring WEC's overall quote to approximately £25000 giving ~12K difference.
5.  I imagine that is just a typo, I can get them to correct it when we submit the order.
