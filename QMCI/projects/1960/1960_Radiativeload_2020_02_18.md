## [[sequestim]] having trouble:

       
1st stage PT head is running at 65K

1st stage (Cu) plate is running at ~77K

Top of the 1st stsage lid (on the outside ie light facing) is ~100K.

2nd stage shield is Cu and is running at around 6K.

There is low emissivity lining on the inside of the OVC.

There is no low emissivity lining on the inside of the 1st stage shield.

The 2nd stage lid is not lined either and is actually quite tarnished.

There is no MLI on the 1st or 2nd shields.

The 1st stage shield is around 1mm thick.

They are using a PT405 (0.5W @ 4.2K W, 25W @ 65K)

cf our Sumitomo ([1.5W@4.2K](mailto:1.5W@4.2K), 36W@48K)

Current proposal is to line the 1st stage shield and possibly incorporate other changes that arise from their ongoing discussions. Hope to run next week.
