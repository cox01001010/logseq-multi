# [[2021-02-03]] filter request
      
James  
  
note below request for 1 and 2 THz filters. So I suggest we stick the 2 THz on the cone and recommend that they simply bung the 1 THz in front and use it in series.  
Cheers  
  
Ken

Thanks Ken. So just to clarify: that would be 7k for the pyroelectric detector, amplifier, winston cone + 2 filters? Could you send a quote through for that? 

We would like to go with the 1THz and 2 THz low pass filters.

Thanks,

E.
