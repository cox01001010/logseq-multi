# Measurement on 2020-12-07

device failed to fully transition when looking at 300K. Following measurements made in the lab.


|Load | Diode Voltage (V) | Device Resistance (Ohms)
|-|-|-
|300K|3.212|2.255 k
|metal|3.212|1.933 k 
| N2|3.233| s/c

Diode 60 is on the block which gives ~6.2K when looking at ecosorb and 5.99K when looking at N2.

can't get anything meaningful from amplifier. 

warm up and investigate

## Inspection and modification 2020-11-30

nothing obviously wrong. chip still stuck down, clips ok. swap G10 det isolation to Cu coated PCB w/ 4 x 1.5mm strips removed.
