## Conclusion

2021-03-11: there is a massive helium leak on the helium can that must have developed during cooling. Not present during warm lt or lt with N2 in the cans. When the can was warming yesterday afternoon I put helium gas into the can after zeroing the lc and saw a massive rise, even with such a huge background. Nothing when I repeated with the N2 can. Leave to warm up and lt again on Monday to try and locate the leak.

## Follow Up

[[2021-03-15]] leak is in the top half of the He can. NOt present when warm. Introduce N2 to can, get about 20mm in bottom, see leak rate ~5e-8. E-mail TK to see about returning when they deliver ULN95.
