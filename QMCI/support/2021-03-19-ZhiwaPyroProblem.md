**Subject:** Pyroelectric detector

Hello James,

We sold some Pyroelectric detectors to a Shanghai end-user Dr.Hua.   The serial number of detectors 2500 and 2546 have some problems.  The end-user cannot find any signal when there is light.  The end-user connect the detectors to oscilloscope and shine a beam of light on detector.  The graph on the oscilloscope does not change at all. 

Can we ship back the detectors to you for repair ?

Please help to solve the problem.

Hello Ray,

We’re sorry to hear Dr. Hua is having trouble with his detectors. These can come back for repair if necessary, but please note that serial number 2500 was shipped three years ago, so is out of warranty.

We should make some basic checks first though, to make sure they need to come here.

1.  Have these detectors worked for the customer in the past? 
2.  The customer should check the detectors using both battery and external power supply
3.  Is the customer modulating the light?

1.  These units have 20 THz filters, so they should be able to see a hand wave on the oscilloscope

5.  Does the detector response change after

1.  1 min
2.  5 mins
3.  10 mins

7.  Can the customer measure the noise spectra of the unit to compare with the values in their manual?

I note that the detector with serial number 2546 was sold together with 2545. Did that go to the same customer and does it work?

Some feedback from the end-user :

These two detectors have not been used until last week when we check before because the project is behind schedule.

We test detectors on both battery and external power supply condition. 

We used a cellphone flashlight to intermittently shine on the front of detector.   For the other two detector which works well, the output will have a signal change which can be obviously observed immediately.    But for 2500 and 2546, no change can be observed.

For the noise spectra , we will collect the data, and send it to you later.

AND
      
2545 belongs to the same end-user.  It works well.

There is another question from the end-user ---  What's the saturation output voltage of the detector?   Is it 2.5 V?

Best regards
