visited Sadie's Aunt, Rona. Picked up Lorne, no one has decided what to call him - granddad or gramps - sadie has used gramps a few times and it sounds sufficently like "grumps" to work. Got to Rona's around 14:00. She loved [[Maya]] and [[Maya]] loved her. Several fantastic chats between [[Maya]] and Rona. Around half two, sadie's cousin, Ebony arrived with her partner Aaron. Lovely couple who also loved [[Maya]]. [[Maya]] loved seeing new faces and all the attention she got and was chatting away to everyone. Rona laid on a fantastic spread for us including gluten free vegan chocolate shortbread - amazing.
