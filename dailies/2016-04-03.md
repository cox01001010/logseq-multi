maya was already awake when i woke up and was laughing to herself and playing with her feet and gave me the loveliest smile when i came to get her up. same walk as yesterday, but followed it along mill road to link to near Ty Mawr. Maya is still loving turning and does it whenever she can. can still only go one way. She loves being read to by sadie and makes lovely noises, almost reading along with her.
