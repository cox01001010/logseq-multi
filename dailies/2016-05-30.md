Lovely bank holiday. Maya is *really* taking to food now. She and Sade have a great routine where Sade gives her some finger food to start with and follows it with pureed fruit or vegetables. So, for breakfast, Maya starts with crumpet, whic is covered in butter. She plays with it for a bit, sucks off ALL of the butter, and then chews the rest of it. Because you have to be mindful of salt content, Maya is enjoying Sainsbury's finest salt free butter and Sainsbury's finest buttermilk(!) crumpets! She does eat maybe half of the half over, say, 3 to 5 minutes, before Sade gives her puree. For breakfast she has mosty been enjoying banana, but today she had blueberry muslei, which had yogurt and oats in. She loved it, and is now leaning forward to meet the spoon.
