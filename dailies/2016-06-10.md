There was a fairly tough start to the week but it has ended on a lovely note. Sade has been ill for a while, and last weekend, was exhausted with a virus which was compunded by conjunctivitus. It came on suddenly on Sunday and cased her excruciating pain and on Monday the GP gaver her eye drops. Luckily it hasn't spread to Maya, but she had the virus too, and at the start of the week was so tired and grumpy and not taking sleep. Sade started putting Maya straight down into her bed, rather than nurse her to sleep, which is what she had been doing.
