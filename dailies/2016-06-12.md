We went to the cinema as a three and watched (some) of King Fu Panda 3. Maya was enchanted by the pictures for an hour or so before she got tired and we left. She sat on sade and leaned back, taking ot all in. It was so nice being all together. After the film we walked around the bay and went to Wetherspoons and had lunch. Me and Sade had 3bean chile and chips. maya had some chips.
