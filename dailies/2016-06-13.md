Sade had a busy day with Maya. Lots of walking! She walked to town and we met during my lunch break. We went to a park and Maya even sat in a swing! She didn't like it though so we stopped quite quickly. It was so nice meeting for lunch. Maya loves us being a three and seemed as excited to se me as I was to see them - she clenches and shaekes her fists and kicks her feet. She gave me a lovely smile when I picked her up - I feel so lucky to spend my life with Sade and Maya. Sade walked back to sainsburys and I met them there, which, again was lovely. She ended up walking the whole way because Maya sleptt for an hour and three quarters in her pram. When we got home, Maya was knackered and after being put down went to sleep in 5 mins. She loves sleeping on her front, which alarms us a bit, but she looks so peaceful and always manages to turn her head to one side. She's strong enough now to lift her head and no matter how often we turn her onto her back she turns onto her front. As I write this, Sade is feeding Maya in her bedroom. I am in the lounge and can her Maya's gentle sucking over the baby monitor. I can also occasionaly hear the blackbird that is singing outside. It's a lovely.re
