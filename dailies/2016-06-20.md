Sade took Maya to Sainsbury's for lunch. She loves being around people and especially loves eating around people. She tried giving her some sweet potato puree on the weekend and Maya wasn't interested, but eating in sainsbury's Maya loved it! We went up a nappy size! From size 3 to size 4+!. Maya is sleeping really well at the moment. Sade puts her down around 17:00 - 18:00 and sd  she sleeps until 9 ish, when she has a top up, and then stays down until between 5 and 6  in the morning.
