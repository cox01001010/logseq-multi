Went to town again as it was changeable weather. We splashed out and got Maya a ring toy from John Lewis with the vouchers we got from work. Maya really enjoys playing with it and shaking it. It's got 8 rings which you can interlink into whatever shape you want - we do them all in a line and she shakes them and chews on one at a time. We went to Wagamamas for lunch - i had a delicous ramen thing and sade had a veggie curry. Maya ate a bit of a cheese sandwhich and a spoonful of sweet potato puree. She was knackerd and teething though, so she wasn't very happy. She slept as we walked back to the car - which was parked up by llandaff fields and was happy as larry when we she woke up at the car. We went to Ty Mawr for a couple of shandies as the sun had come out by then. It was such lovely afternoon all being together outside on a pub bench with lovely views over the city. Something struck Maya as funny as we walked from the car to the pub as she started laughing at me and I started laughing back and Sade laughed too and we all laughed together. Really special moment. When we sat on the bench Maya enjoyed chewing on my beer glass and we took funny pictures of her and me chewing the glass and looking wasted. Once Maya went down at home, me and Sade had a lovely evening drinking wine, playing GTAV and eating crisps.
