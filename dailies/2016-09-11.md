Trip to the Forest of Dean. Lovely walk from Speculation to the place the cafe. Sade and I had chips while Maya had a pouch of spaghetti bolognase. Maya loved the walk. She sits upright in her pushchair with her hands holding the rail and looking all around and pointing at every tree, plant and leaf  she sees. Occasionally we'll pull a branch down to her so she can touch the leaf. Sade gave her a leaf to hold which she loved. On the way home we stopped at The Boat - a delightful pub on the river Wye by the village of redbrook. One of my favourite places. Excellent pint of Butty Bach and Sade had Guinnes. We had jalapeno crips and dry roasted nuts. Maya wanted to crawl about so we let her on the floor and she played with beer mats, leaflets, library cards and my keys. Special day.
