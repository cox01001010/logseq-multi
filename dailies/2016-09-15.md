Thu Really good nights sleep - Maya didn't stir until 06:45! Neither me nor Sade had to get up and give her back her dummy. When Maya woke up she still had her dummy and was really groggy. Really happy in the morning. She's loving crawling around and doing what she pleases. She keeps making a bee-line for the bin in the kitchen so she can sit and play with the bin liner and try and pull it down. I'm trying not to make it into a game by reacting, but am still trying to disuade her from playing with the bin. I am not succeeding. She gives me this knowinggrin when she gets to the bin and starts touching it. Oh yeah, Maya found my tattoo today and kept poking it. I love her so much.
