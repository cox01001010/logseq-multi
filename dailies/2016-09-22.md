Thu Maya has been amazing the last week. Really into her crawling, starting to notice cupboards and doors. We went to Lauren and Jamie's wedding on the weekend, and Maya was brilliant. Her sleep pattern was disturbed and she had lots of late nights but she was full of beans. Again, loving being around people and utterly charmed everyone she met. Uncle Steve and Auntie Gwyneth were particularly happy to see her, and spent a lot of time making sure me and sade could have a good time. The day after the weeding we saw Nan Cox, who is 90 years old and 1 week old. They loved each other, and it was touching to see how much Maya cheered up Nan.
