Mon this weekend went to library on sat am and mueseum PM. met sade at sainsburys then went home. sunday went to IKEA. Maya LOVED it. perfect for her - she can walk around the showroom bits. She loved seeing other people and shouting "Hiya!" at them. Lots of people really taken with her, she is unbeliveably cute at the moment. One lady particularly taken and playing peekaboo with her and shouting Hiya back. Lovely scruffy pink cardy and blue dress.
