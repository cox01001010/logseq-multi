Tue Sadie and maya met alice and bon at conton library for rhyme time maya is on really good form at the mo and we are all really happy, her talking and understanding has taken some massive leaps and we can now, and have for a while, been able to have conversations with her. they're really mostly "yes/no" questions, but today i asked her who she had seen and she was able to say "bonnie" " who else was there" "alice". maya is fucking beatiful and i love her and sade so much. she has started taking tentative unsupported steps and the most she has taken that i have seen is four. she is really good at falling on her bum. she has four teeth she says "Hiya!" a lot! everything and one is daddy she loves her mummy she doesn't like beards
