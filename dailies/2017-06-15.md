Thu maya and sade went to caerphilly and played in a water park where if you press buttons on the ground water comes out. maya loved it even thought the waterwas freezing and she was a bit unsure about the water at first. she has started singing along with us when we sing the words to songs like wheels on the bus and wonderful world. we were given a welsh language book for wonderful world which we all sing along to. she gets some of the words and definitely gets the intonation it is a truly beatiful thing to hear and especially to share as a three.
