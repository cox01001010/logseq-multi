Sun last weekend and this week have been hot. we went to friends of sadie's, ali and rog, on saturday. they have the most beautiful garden and live in a place called newent, which is just short of ross. maya enjoyed sitting in the mud in the stream and ali bought out a bucket with water for her to sit in a little later. she loved it and stood up in it singing and splashing. maya had been a bit demmanding the days leading up to saturday, and was again when we were at ali and rog's, so neither sade nor i really relaxed or fully engaged in conversation because we kept being shouted at by my. rog and ali lived her and thought she was very well behaved, which she was, it's just that we can't sit back while she needs to be attended to. after we left them, we were all hot so we stopped off at ross on the way back and went to a swing set and slide by the river, near the hope and anchor, which is where sade and i used to meet on a friday evening when i would come and visit her on the weekend. we fed the ducks and swans and some baby ducks came for bread too. maya is incredibally sweet as whenever we leave anything she shouts "bye bye xxx" and blows them a kiss. she did it with the ducks and kept saying baby ducks. i carried her to the car on my shoulders.
