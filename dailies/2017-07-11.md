Tue sadie had a consultation with a gynae at heath and i took my. after she'd finished there was no point going back to work so we went to the park at heath, which was brilliant. my loved the swings and saw some 3-4 year olds being noisy who were shouting down the slide. she climbed up the tube slide then came back down again. after that we went to the robin hood and had a cone of chips. maya had a tea of quavers and chips and loved it. lovely day.
