Sun second day of my holiday. we have been living in barry, 13 southesk place for about two months now. we are all really loving it. lovely day. beautiful bed time. maya is starting to read along. she doesn say all the words, but she does end the sentence with you. the intonation is perfect. as we read sugarlump and the unicorn, she turned to me and we finished the sentecne together truly special moment
