Wed maya has been very difficult and challenging, bordering on agressive. we've seen it before, around feb-march of this year, but because she is more articulate and bigger now, there is no mistaking her intention. she hits me and sade a lot, and pinches our faces. she mostly does this after being denied something or having to do something. it has been increasing how much she does it with out provication though, which is a worry. we're hoping its a phase and thankfully she only does it to me and sade.
