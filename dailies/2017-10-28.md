Sat Huge day! Maya said Fuck in the correct context probably not a great thing and we should stop swearing in front of her. She squeezed a juice box and it came out of the straw and went on her steps she uses to get to the work surface and as soon as she did she said Fuck! Unfortunately, me and Sade laughed so we may have made it at thing. More importantly, she used a potty for the first time. Sade got it for her quite a while ago and we let her know it was there, but there was never any pressure to use it, but let her know she could use it if she wanted, but she never has. Neve is a 3 year old who has come to visit and has used it which sort of piqued her interest, but she didnt want to do it right away. Tonight she wanted to do and asked for it. She spent ~15 minutes siting on it, getting slowly undressed(!) and eventually, after having a small accident on the floor, weeed in the potty. We are so proud! Also, Sade cut maya's hair in the week and it looks lovely. We had a really lovely special day today. laundrette, walk, wall humpty dumpty, train station, lidl, tesco, lunc fed teh ducks, swings wee in a potty. Lovely and we are all so happy.
