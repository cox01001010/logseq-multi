Fri Maya's 2nd Birthday! We went to bristol zoo and on the saturday had a birthday party with all her friends at a church hall in penarth. She loved both days. Bristol zoo was ace, we were all knackered for some reason, it was a bad night for some reason, and maya was a bit narky, but she loved seeing the animals. we saw, lions (who were very sad), amazing vampire bats which totally freaked out sade maya didnt care, snakes, reptiles, insects, penguins, turtles,
