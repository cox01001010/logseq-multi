Wed maya and sade went to Nom's (Naomi's) who is the mum of Obi(sp?) and they had fish and chips for lunch. Martha (3) was there and she blocked the toilet and shat her pants. after lunch sade and maya fed the ducks at knap lake. maya ate some of the bread as she is wont to do. we had a nice evening, playing with a ball and peppa and george pig. i enjoyed aggrivating maya by using peppa to tackle her, she got quite cross.
