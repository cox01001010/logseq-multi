Tue yesterday Maya and Sade went to Barry library in the morning for Rhyme time. They sing songs and read stories. Maya really loves it as all her friends are there. Yesterday it was Obi, Nom and Dave. Nom and Dave are Obi's parents. They went to the park after and maya and obi playeed as shopkeepers and dave was their customer. Sade and Maya went to Morrisons for lunch and Maya had chicken nuggets and chips sade had a jacket potato. When I got off the train, sade and maya were playing in the play park which was a real treat to see. We played peter rabbit for a bit and maya totally freaked out while i was mr fox. Maya ate really well at tea so had chocolate. We taped her eating it, which is a joy to see.
