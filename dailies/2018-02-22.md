Thu yesterday sade took maya to the cinema at cardiff bay to watch a lego movie. it was a bit much for maya who got a bit scared, so mummy took her out for some fresh air. a litlle later, maya fell over, but mummy made it better. mummy is a good lady. that is what maya was able to tell me last night. her language is incredible, and her emotional understanding is so advanced. she is a bright cookie and we lover her very much. we have a new sofa an ikea norsberg, which has a chaisse lounge. it is so damn comfortable.
