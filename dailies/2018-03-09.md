Fri Obi and Nom came round yesterday afternoon and were still there when I got home. It was beautiful to see the interaction between Maya and Obi. They are so sweet together. When I got back they were jumping up and throwing themselves down on the bed. Just cracking themselves and each other up. When they had to go they had the most lovely cuddle and kiss. Maya does this really sweet thing now where she closes her eyes when she hugs and pulls her lips together in a thin smile. Beautiful children. We had pie and potatoes for tea and me and maya went into the garden to get the washing in while sade did tea. Maya kept saying "one more chance" which is apparantly what nom was saying to obs as he almost fell off a cliff. the snomwan, who's name i have forgotten lasted until wednesday night. just a nub at the end.
