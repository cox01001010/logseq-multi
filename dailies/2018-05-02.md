Wed we started potty training last friday. we've had the potty since around xmas, and maya had a few wees then, but hasn't taken any since then until thursday, when she had a sudden interest in the potty. Since Friday she has been nappy free except at night in bed and has taken every wee in the potty. the poos have taken longer, and she has been in her knickers everytime, but was getting closer to doing it in the potty each time. today though, at around 5 minutes to 9 this morning, she did it in the potty all on her own while sade was face washing. then to top it, they called me at work and maya told me on the phone what she had done so proud!!
