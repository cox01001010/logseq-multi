Mon really lovely weekend. on saturday we all went into cardiff together on the train. Maya and I went to get my hair cut and Sade went to look for some pajamas and to have a bit of time to her self. Maya was really good at the barbers even though the guy took ages 20 mins. She was really patient and came up to me a few times to hold my hand, which was really sweet, but spent most of the time sitting on the bench waiting. There was a father there with two boys who was lovely and kept telling my that she was being a really good girl. The family appeared to be of middle eastern origin, and the father was so lovely and engaged with his boys, in particular the youngest who was a bit apprehensive about getting his hair cut. The father kept telling him how proud he was of him and how well he was doing. Really lovely to see. Someone gave her a lollipop which she loved and spent the next 20 mins licking. We had a picnic lunch in Bute and met up with Sade afterwards and got the train back
