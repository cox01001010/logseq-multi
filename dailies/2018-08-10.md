NOT REAL DATE but orphaned entries. very sweet this morning. lying on her tummy singing "you are my sunshine" at luna, who is the more shy one of the two. together. We had a bbq at rob and sals and lorne was there too. Rob and Sal were delightful with Maya and really engaged with her. Sal got her to chop up potatoes and help with the salad and Rob took her round the garden and veg patch. Then he played balloon football with her, which she loved and cracked her up. It was a late night (9pm) for my and she was grumpy as hell on Sunday morning. She had a bit of a nap on the way to asda, but not enough, and was cranky. We went to Emma's birthday party in the evening and drank a lot of gin. Sade made a delicious kedgeree and it was another late night, but maya slept in a bit longer and seems to be in a better mood. It was so nice to see her with all her friends on sunday evening. Emma is India's and Aiyla(?)'s mum, Duncan is her husband. Nom and Dave were there too with Obi. Nom is really pregnant now due in 7 weeks.  we had a lovely day yesterday, shopping and looking in ikea for new stuff for when we move to barry. sunday barry beach amazing yesterday looking after bonnie and went to see lego batman now. may has woken from a sleep saying mummy mummy.
