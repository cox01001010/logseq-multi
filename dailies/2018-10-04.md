Thu sadie and maya met emma, india and a baby that emma was child minding at jackson's bay. despite the cold, indi decided to sit in the sea, which my copied. maya also told me this (friday) morning that she had peed in her pants in the sea. they went back to ours pretty quickly and had a bath to warm up, then indi got dressed for school and they left after lunch. maya was very good at listening to sade today (awful the day before) and we'd agreed that if she listened really well she could have some keys that i brought home from work, which we did. she is very happy with these random old bike lock keys.
