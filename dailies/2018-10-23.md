Tue beautiful evening. burning red sunset over the harbour, high tide, massive full moon rising, big wheel lit up. maya was watching tv when i got back at 6.30. in thhe night garden. she danced along to the carousel song i love it when she blows kisses like uppsy daisy. my bedtime. we read baby yoga and gruffalo. overtired and massive screqaming fit which hasnt happened in a long time. difficult to deal with. sade calmed her down. maya is under the weather with a cold and is a bit snuffly. things are better with me and sade, but it has been very hard. i'll write more another day but i think we'll be ok. brexit is still a slowly unfurling disaster. no real soln. to the Ireland issue. daily mail is slowly changing it's tone (a change in editor from Dacre to Grieg) which is making it less ridiculously inflamatory and is now holding rees-mogg, daivs and johnson to account for sabotaging may.
