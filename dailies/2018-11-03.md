Sat si and al took maya for the day. me and sade went to asda to get some food and had a nice lunch of gnocchi with a tomato sauce and sidesalad. we had a chocolate cake thing and chocolate icecream made from coonuts for dessert. really lovely. then we read the papers. nice to connect again with sade. (as an aside, the byi fireworks are going off and i can see them from the kitchen window). its been tough with me and sade. different responses to stress and tiredness, an imbalance in the domestic responsibilities, personal neglect, partner neglect, me not listening or truly engaging with what sade was saying(*) have led us to the point where we were considering taking a break. (**) will write more on that later. but today, we had really good quality talks together, reconnected and considered our future together. it was a lovely day. maya was asleep when she got back in simons car. she woke and had crumpet and milk and is bed now. we had crumpets with coconut cheese, marmite and pickle and are now about to start Killing Eve. a tv program, not an activity
