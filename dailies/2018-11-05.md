Mon sadie and maya went to rhyme time at barry library and then morrisons for lunch. sade got some last craft bits for mayas party (sock monster things) too. i went in late so didnt get home 'til maya was in bed. sade said that maya didn't mind, she actually said good she likes having sade to herself sometimes. maya woke at 5am, but went back just after 6 until 8.15. latest wakeup ever! me and sade are enjoying killing eve in the evenings. kittens are doing good but luna seems a little more needy of emotional support and cuddles at the moment.
