Tue we all got the 8.40 train in together and sade and maya got off at grangetown to go to ikea. maya had a second breakfast of sausage, hash brown and omlette then went to play land. there were no other kids there, but she had a great time colourimg in and chatting to the ladies. sade made a delicious curry and dahl for dinner. it's american midterm elections today. interesting to see how americans rate the first 2 years of trump. cnn, fox et al. refused to run an ad sponsored by trump because of the untruths and racism expressed within. must be bad for fox to say no. me and sade finished killing eve. slightly nutty ending, but fun.
