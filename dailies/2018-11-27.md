Tue in the last few weeks Maya turned three. we had a party for her friends at home on the 10th. Lucy, Isla, Indi, Oscar and Bonnie came together with their parents. Really fun day. Music that Maya loves, chicken nuggets, oizza, pringles, cakes, pass the parcel, cats locked in our room, squash. Everyone had gone by around 2.30, so we put on the tele and chilled out after we'd tidied up. Maya was exhausted. We had the Monday off to see a show at the Memo, but it was cancelled so we went to Ikea for breakfast and then home we were all knackered. On mayas birthday we went to the cinema early to see incredibles 2. she loved it and we really treated her, allowed her to pick snacks from tesco to eat, she chose pringles, sweets and smartie egg thing. we then went to M&S for fishfinger sandwhiches, ket her pick some paw patrol sofrt toys, (everest, skye and dr. feathers), and went on the carosel in town which she always wants to go on. then home for a treaty tea. this weekend has been lvely. we had simons car to go to lucy's party, but she was ill, so we went to techniquest instead. had tesco sandwhiches in the car, maya tried the prawn salad and loved it, as well as her chicken roll. techniquest was awesome. maya loved the water, sade loved the crane things and i lovd the photographic plate. awesome.
