fun evening after dinner. Sadie had said that lowen had been really playful during the day, and he was again after dinner. he was playing with a block sorting toy, putting the shapes into the bucket, then mixing them up and then handing them out. he started by handing them to sadie, and then maya and then me. we would put our hands out and he would put the shapes in, each of us in turn, then take them back an put them in the bucket. we did this for around 15 minutes. he had a bath after and pooed on my arm a bit as i carried him through and maya came too so i could do her teeth before bed. always slightly hectic and i was narky because of that but we took a breath and calmed down. after the bath i had a lovely little play with lowen, flipping his bottom lip as he blew to make funny noises and we both laughed. he went down on his milk (as he always does) and slept from 19:00 til about 23:00, then he came in with us for the rest of the night and was really chilled with it. the last few (lots) nights he hasn't been when he's been in with us, he's wriggled like crazy, but sadie held him for about 10 minutes  to relax him and get him to sleep. his poo is better, he still strains like crazy, but isn't getting so distressed with it. before bed, me and sadie talked about the house move to coytrahen, which is 9 days away. we are so excited, but it feels kind of surreal, abstract and daunting at the same time. it won't feel real until we have the keys and are in with working electricity and gas etc.
