Maya's friend from school, Mylar, has to isolate because her mum, brother, Nan and granddad have covid. Her dad doesn't. Mylar has a test today and will get the results tomorrow. If she has it, the whole class will have to isolate and they won't do their nativity :white_frowning_face:.

Nice weekend. stayed in the whole time. Did some packing today. Good to spend time with everyone as a family. Lovely playing with Maya, drawing characters from her advent disney books. Lovely with Sadie. Nice cuddle last night and really feeling like we are doing it together. Getting ready for the move. Sadie felt a little vulnerable last night. Suddenly all feels a bit real.

got the next 4 weeks off and really looking forward to it. 

solicitor draws on the money from HSBC tomorrow - so hopefully once that is done, we are home and dry with the house buying.
