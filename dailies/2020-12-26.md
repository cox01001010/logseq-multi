Nice day at home. 
Christmas day was difficult. Sade and I both struggled to give the kids what they want and need. As always neglect ourselves. 
Today was better. 
Me and Sade played some golf on the Xbox while Maya and Lowen watched. Then Maya had a go.

We had a mega walk a couple of days ago and Maya and Sadie drew pictures
