Me and [[Maya]] went back to Barry island to finish off the house and drop off the keys. Cleaned the inside of the car too and got some bits from ASDA. Police positioned at the entrance to the promenade because of covid lockdown level 4. Toys and non essential items are not for sale because of lockdown. Makes no sense. The rest of the shop is open.
Came home and Sade was super chilled with Lowen. He was eating beans on toast. After lunch we had a great walk to Maya's school to try out the route.
