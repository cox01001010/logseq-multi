- terrible nights sleep, [[Lowen]] wriggled for ages
- struggled to get up, as did [[Sadie]]. 
- I was grumpy as hell with [[lowen]] and [[maya]] [[parenting]] the whining by lowen is especially grating first thing in the morning and he won't be put down - just whinges and cries
- this sucks for [[Sadie]] in the week, but she's great at handling it
- nice porridge breakfast in the end and out on time 
- [[Sadie]] is a bit despondent about starting the week on her own
- [[Sadie]] does amazing, but it is so hard on your own, and so lonely, so easy to loose identity, especially now we can't meet up with anyone
  - [x] check to see if she can meet up with sian outside (don't know current rules)
  - no (https://gov.wales/alert-level-4-frequently-asked-questions#section-58320)
- read about [[Avoidant attachment]]
- [[Sadie]] had a shocking day. Tried to just ease into the day after I left, i.e. not go tearing out for a walk or immediately start entertaining the kids, allowing them to play. Neither of them do, and they both start hounding her and things escalate until they go for a walk.
- [[Sadie]] is generally struggling with her role. Because I am away all day and she is the sole, lone parent, she gets swallowed by the kids and their needs and demands. Both are lovely children, but are highly demanding and strung. Things can explode (or rupture) very easily and it's hard for Sade to maintain equilibrium. It's been six years since we fell pregnant with Maya, and Sadie's life has become almost solely focused on the kids and family. We need to find a way for her to find space and time for herself, it's hard anyway, but now even more so because of the [[covid]] [[pandemic]]. Being able to meet and go for a walk with Sian, for me and Sade to have a day together alone, that is all we would need, but that's impossible at the moment so we need to find other ways of doing that.
- [[family]] (minus me) did go for a walk in the morning though to a place called [[Shwt]] and followed a footpath we identified yesterday as being interesting. Path is old mining path, so apparantly can't ever be anything other than a public footpath. It leads to a wood and a kindly gentleman told [[Sadie]] how to get there. They got a little muddled and ended up in a private garden, where a lovely lady (Jackie) asked them what they were doing (nicely) and explained it was a  private garden. She took them back to the path where the gentleman, her husband, Jeff, told them about them and their land. They bought the extra land and woods off a farmer cheap because it wasn't good farming land and have been there around 30 years. Jeff played pooh sticks with Maya and they talked about their grandchildren. Everyone is struggling with this [[covid]] situation that is now just dragging. It's a year since it started ramping up and 10 months since we started [[social distancing]]. I am naturally introverted and independent (or [[Avoidant attachment]]), and even I would like to see people, go to the cinema, go for a meal (not fucking [[McDonalds]]). It's super hard for Sade because there are no groups, no soft play, no libraries, no museums, no pubs, no meeting friends, nowhere to go apart from the woods (which we are lucky for) and home. It's too fucking much.
