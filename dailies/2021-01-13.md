# Log

- work on [[dahengenquiry-2021-01-07]]
- work on [[khachiwan-buakor]] email
- rome meeting (2 hours :( )
- pack peter's compressor, get ips into that lab
- tyrone is upset with chris (and by extension ken and adam) struggling with feeling that chris is a glory boy and that he doesn't get the recognition he deserves
  - there is a greater theme here about the lack of transparency in management relations. 
    - too many one on one office conversations
- [[sadie]] had a shit day again. similar reasons to [[2021-01-11]], the sheer fucking intensity and relentlessness of her day to day, hard anyway, but [[covid]] [[lockdown]] makes it much mouch more. nothing is open. only leave home for exercise or food shopping. [[lowen]] is heavy so no fun carrying him around the woods all day, plus, it's raining all the time. 
- me and [[sadie]] played rayman game
