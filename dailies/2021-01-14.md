- [[sadie]] had a better day, but still sucky. Just so difficult being stuck at home. She tried the sling on her back, but it's insanely difficult to do. Tried the red one that I got from Hargreave, but it's way too big for her.
  - [>] find a better back sling for [[sadie]]
- we went to sainsbury's in the evening to return some clothes and pick up food. Really fun, like the most fun day out in ages [[covid]] [[lockdown]]
- really lovely seeing [[lowen]] and [[maya]] interact with other people. [[lowen]] especially, as he is a true [[lockdown]] baby, but amazingly sociable in spite of it. [[maya]] had a chat with the lovely lady who served us on the till. all about her school and the woman's grandchildren. 
- lovely evening with [[sadie]] afterwards. just nice chilling out and being together.
- the [[otter]] came!
