- reading  "The new Covid variants are a peril to us all" by Adam Kucharski FT 2021-01-15 [[covid]]  ref: https://www.ft.com/content/5691b1bb-0f9f-4410-9ade-84f4d55ea778
  - at least three known mutations / variants
    - uk (501Y.V1), south africa (501Y.V2), brazil (501Y.V3)
    - uk is more transmissable, but there is no evidence that vaccines will not work 
    - worry with south african and brazil, is that they had high population infection (high antibody levels) to first wave, that in spite of this, and summer, they are rising, and dying again.
    - south african varian can dodge immune responses in the lab by "disguising it self" ie vaccines may not be as effective
    - diseases like HIV suggest viruses evolve to be more deadly, but, with Sars-Cov-2, transmission is early in infection, so there is no evolutionary advantage to the virus being less deadly
    - unkown how vaccines will drive evolutionary pressure
    - >One [recent study](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.12.17.423313v1) suggests seasonal coronaviruses evolve gradually to evade immunity generated in precedingÂ years, leading to reinfections over time
