lovely family day, amazing walk in the snow, [[Sadie]] took amazing photos and we both got a bit emotional about how much the house in [[Coytrahen House]] gives us. A truly magical location that surpasses even our wildest dreams when we were thinking about the future. We never thought we would be able to buy a house, let alone one that was in such beautiful surroundings. And such a nice house too - spacious, warm, garden - we are truly lucky.

That's not to say that there aren't tricky bits. Sadie has a rreally hard day, in extreme circumstances. Looking after a 1-2 year old is hard anyway, but during [[lockdown]], with [[Maya]] off school, with nothing open, and no possibility of meeting friends for at least some companionship it's really hard. We've had our struggles too, various aspects of my peronality make me difficult to live with. I struggle with [[Avoidant attachment]] and am naturally independent and don't think a lot about my emotions, how i feel about things. I don't give voice to my inner self and am pretty disconnected, fragmented. That, with not supporting [[Sadie|sade]] enough, means our relationship is in a bad place. Sade is clear that she wouldn't have started a family with me if she knew this was me. I struggle between work and home, and do find it difficult to give support to sadie. i make things too much about me, and limit ideas, opportunities, before they are even voiced because i am scared of being rejected. at the start with [[maya]] i felt that i wasnt allowed to do things, that sadie had a way of doing things, and because she was the stay at home parent, i deferred to that, but that ended up becoming my go to,  and i guess i stopped even trying, or pushing. I need to reset, and get back to pushing. i have to accept that i will be rejected, hurt, but that i just have to go through it to get to where i want to be.
