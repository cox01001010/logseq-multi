	- need 0.2mm dia Cu wire for ULT thermometry
- [[Sadie]] had a better day. Simple as a few minutes of quiet to collect her thoughts. [[lowen]] took a decent nap and [[sadie]] and [[Maya]] watched [[autumnwatch]]. [[Sadie]] was in a bad way yesterday - really struggling, utterly overwhelmed by it all all. The endlessness of this period, don't know when we're back at school - it's really fucking hard for her. She does amazing to pull it back, but it always takes a toll. Thoughts of [[death]] and [[suicide]] are always common this time of year.

- We all played snakes and ladders after dinner. [[Lowen]] through a dice!   #diary
