Hello,

I am looking to buy the bonded enameled Cu wire, particulary:

0.2mm Solderable Grade 1 Bifilar Enamelled Copper Wire on D125 Reel
Ref: BB0200S-D125

I used to have a reel that measured 0.2mm with the enamel on - would that be the same wire, or do I need the next size up?

I would like to issue a PO and pay via BACS. Ideally I'd like 30 days terms, but would understand if you'd prefer payment up front.

I haven't looked - how much is delivery?

Cheers,
James
