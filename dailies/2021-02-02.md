Hi Beverley,

Weâ€™re sorry to ask again as we know you must be busy, but we just wanted to check that we are correct to expect the seller to have arranged for FENSA indemnity. We appreciate it must be difficult to get answers for the sellers solicitors right now, but wanted to check that this is your understanding too.

With best regards and thanks,

James and Sadie
