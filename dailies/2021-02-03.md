# Journal

- jeff bezos steps down as ceo of amazon. utterly transformed retail and technology - interesting [[The Relentless Jeff Bezos]]
- awful day for [[sadie]] yesterday. [[lowen]] was in with us from about 1am, not sleeping until 3.30am. Miserable and grumpy all day. Screaming and hollering. Demanding attention and ruining the day for both [[sadie]] and [[maya]]. we had a nice evening together on the bed talking about the situation. Nothing really changes for sadie. it's un-relentlessly difficult for her. the age difference is hard too - both kids need different things. sade would walk all day or at least be out w/ [[lowen]] to keep busy and him occupied, but it's difficult with maya. she's great at walking, but it can be too much.
- we're looking at getting a chainsaw for the trees out the back of [[Coytrahen House]]
