#diary [[lowen]] is sleeping really badly at the moment and comes in early, around 9 or 10pm and stays the night. He had his last formula milk on [[2021-02-08]] and last night had cows milk during bed time. until now he has been going to sleep on the milk and it's real easy to transfer him, but the last couple of nights he hasnt transferred and we've had to spend more time with him to soothe him. i've been able to leave [[maya]] almost asleep and transfer him and we're done, but last night he doesn't transfer and maya is also upset. while i'm soothing lowen, [[sadie]] is with maya who says the most heart breaking thing "i know bing-bong isn't real, but at night i wish he was". she's been saying bing-bong from inside out is her imaginary friend and is with us on our walks. sade soothed her and she slept well, she's so sweet.
