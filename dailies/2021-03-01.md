# Diary

**Monday**

Maya first day using taxi service. Took her to the wrong site! She was understandably upset - especially as she had been saying "this isn't my school, I go to the other one." Luckily, she told a kind teacher that her teacher was Mrs Pomeroy-Watkins, and she said "well that's lucky as Mrs PW is y best friend." Got a radio and MandS food for sadie tomorrow. Car broke down on the M4 on the way home. I got the car because I am staying at home working the next few days while the fascias are done so wont be getting the train. Got home late after the kids were in bed. Roadside assistant says its the auxillary drive belt.
