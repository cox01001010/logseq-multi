shittiness. instant trouble and aggravation between [[Sadie]] and me. Trying to find a garage to fix the car and sadie takes exception at how long it is taking and how i am doing it. takes a comment i make about how i feel about gender stereotypes and how i should know what i am talking about and points out weird and unnatural i am being on the phone. this is about more than the car, and is captures how she sees me and feels towards me. neither of which are good. sadie finds mobile mechanics which could be handy as the car wont move, but unfortunately non of them call back. go with a garage in Maestag and use the roadside assistance to tow it there. we had a nice lunch of bits i got from M&S. Shallots, dauphinoise potatoes and salad. save the fish pie for the weekend. scaffolding is put up for fascias.
