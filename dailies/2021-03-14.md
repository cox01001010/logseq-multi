## Personal

mothers day. [[Maya]] made a lovely card at school and a cake. I got some chocolate for her to give to [[Sadie]] too and [[lowen]] did a card. went for a lovely walk at [[parc calon lan]] which led onto [[blaengarw]]. Really lovely walk. Picked up some salmon for lunch, and had a lazy afternoon playing games and drinking gin in the early evening. [[lowen]] is really coming into his own now and is such a member of the family. Cheeky and funny - so full of personality, [[Maya]] is amazing, so smart, so funny and dry, so caring and empathetic. She has a lovely relationship with [[sadie]] and she is her rock and constant. we have a more strained relationship. I aggravate her by how I ask her to do things, my manner is not great, i probably seem a bit removed too, not really engaging with things or her. i probably dont get down into it enough. i guess that's my approach to most things. trying to get to the resolution rather than digging into the nitty gritty. 

the last few weeks have been pretty tough with me and [[Sadie]]. too tired to write about it now.
