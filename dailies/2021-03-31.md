Hello Ray,

Iâ€™m afraid that the customer does not seem to be following good pumping protocol. You must tell them not to use any liquid cryogens again until we receive satisfactory answers to our questions. They have neither followed the instructions in the manual nor answered my questions below. Our cryostats are designed with safety in mind, but they are operating them in a dangerous manner. They must not use liquid nitrogen again until we resolve the pumping issue.

I can see two potential problems immediately:

1.  The cryostat may be too far away from the pump/gauge
2.  The top plate of the cryostat seems to be frozen during filling

**Problem 1**

From the photos they have sent, I cannot see a gauge on the cryostat, so it must be on the pump. I can also see that there are at least two vacuum lines connecting the cryostat to the pump. This means the cryostat is not close to the pump and the gauge is not close to the cryostat. Therefore, the pressure that is present in the cryostat is worse than what they are measuring at the pump. The pressure they are measuring (~e-1 mBar) is ok if that is what is in the cryostat, but I doubt that is present in the cryostat.

In your original e-mail, you said that he thought the pumping speed was too slow.
