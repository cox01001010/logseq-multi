# Journal

last week, [[maya]] was upset because a girl she had been playing with, nylar, wouldn't let her join in with a game she was playing with ayla (i think). ayla had been away from school since january, and last monday was her first day back - it was first day back after easter. nylar and ayla were putting soil in a bucket, and there was only one bucket, and maya asked if she could join in and nylar said yes, then no. maya was as upset about the idea that she had done something wrong as she was about not being able to play. we tried to tell her that it wasnt anything she had done, and that sometimes these things happen, and we cant know what nylar was thinking and we dont need to modify our behaviour to fit in, but it did upset her. i asked her tonight whether she played with nylar now, and she said she, nylar and ayla play together and they all like each other. maya is a beautiful, sensitive child who feels and sees too much. i say too much because i worry about how it will affect her, mainly because feelings have paralysed me, hopefully if we can keep talking, expressing and understanding we can all be sensitive, open and content with ourselves and our growth,
