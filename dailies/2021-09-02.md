2021-09-02 11:37 chat with [[peter-ade]] about detector development. he tells me that duscomnbe is coming off filters and will be more of a KID detector development engineer. Peter believes we could call on his efforts for development work. I think that there should be two strands for QMCI. 1. Internal development work w/ [[rashmi]] [[dunscombe]] [[peter-ade]] 2. Once we have recipes these should be sent out for commercial manufacture. two known options already: scs Glasgow, ics cardiff. ICS aren't capable yet.

## Diary for 2021-09-02

a lot of talk about waning protection from vaccinations. currently estimated that pfizer gives ~6months while "natural" gives ~10 months. https://twitter.com/dvir_a/status/1431898082283819010?s=20 this is from using israel data.

uk is talking about "top ups" for half a million vulnerable. there is no talk about nationwide third dose.
