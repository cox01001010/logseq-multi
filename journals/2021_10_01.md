- #journal [[2021-10-01]] sade leaves to go to als w the kids. i make an appointment for alcohol counselling. 19:51 sitting here in an empty house listening to a podcast (smartless - will arnett, bateman, and sean hayes )with sam harris. trying not to think about things when they start talking about death, afterlife, ayousca, near death experiences and i feel really uncomfortable, almost freaking out, wanting to drink. but i dont. i start reading about mediation and cook a pizza.
