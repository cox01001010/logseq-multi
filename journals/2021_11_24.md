- #journal [[sadie]] is super tired at the moment. She came on really early today, maybe 10 days early. Things are still really bad between us. Showered maya and washed her hair. Listened to the radio, WFMU double dip recess which slowed down some of the mania. I got angry when lowen banged maya's head just as i was about to read a book.  it upset maya that i was angry and felt it was directed at her. i sometimes struggle with being angry with lowen for being difficult which is really unfair of me. I need to chill the fuck out.
