- #journal stayed home today. Did some work, pissed ken off, cancelled rome telecon, pissed them off. sade seemed better for the rest and it was nice, to spend more time with lowen, though it was stressful, of course.  picked maya up from school rather than get the taxi. went to dinosaur park at mcrthur glen and got macdonalds. fun. sade is tired, but resting is helping. will stay home again tomorrrow.
