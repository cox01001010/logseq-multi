- #journal Bonnie stayed overnight. Tooth fairy came. Kids noticed at 2am... sade is really I'll with diahorrea and nausea. Had to cancel Mayas  party lunch - sade messaged Al to say not to come. Me and the kids took Bonnie back and had birthday cake there. Before we left to go there sade saw a couple of rats next door. Started a good heart to heart before we left which we finished when we got back. I miss her so much.
