- #journal Hugged Sadie yesterday and today. So good to touch. I've missed it so much. Able to go back to work even though sade was getting over a tummy bug. Grateful she stepped up so I could do that. Cold night. Frost. Sade saw a woodpecker. We heard an owl the last couple of nights. We live in a lovely area. Lovely greeting from the kids when I get home. Proper "daddy" from Lowen and Maya comes and meets me at the door.
