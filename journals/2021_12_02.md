- #journal nice evening at home. we're all tired, waiting for the two weeks until xmas. maya slept until 8am today, which never happens. sade got a free disney subscription for a few months and we had a look at what was available. nice wattching little bits of silly movies, like ice age egg thing, kaya and the last dragon. maya seems a bit bummed out at the moment. aware she probably gets bossed about quite a bit at school (by the teachers - who are going mad for the xmas concert). she misses sade, and being with her and probably sees how much lowen gets with sade, and how little she does. we're going to try harder to get one on one time, all of us. i miss hanging out with maya, we used to have fun, we still do, but it was nice when it was just us, and now she misses out a bit and has to share with lowen. lowen is totally happy at the moment. happy with people and happy with himself. can be a massive pain in the arse too - so independent (sade?!)  and furious sometimes, but can be so gentle, tender and empathetic. some lovely cuddles with him sometimes. i'm enjoying reading winnie the pooh to maya at the moment
