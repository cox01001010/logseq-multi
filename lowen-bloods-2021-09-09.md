Hi Babe,

Sorry for doing this over message but it's hard to talk right now. We can talk later, but just got a call from the doctor.

She stresses that there's nothing to worry about, but that Lowen is slighty aneamic.

This is where the red blood cells are low and is common in children. She asked how he was in himself and if he was tired or slow, and I said no. 

She said she needs to refer it to a specialist who will either decide to see him, or ask for us to take supplements and monitor. 

She says we also need to make a confirmatory blood test for two weeks time. This is to confirm the result from last time and they do that all the time. I'll call them and arrange that. We need to pick up the blood form from the front desk at some point before we go for the tests. She says it'll be available today, but I reckon it's worth waiting a day or two.

She really was at pains to say there is nothing to worry about, so hopefully it can be sorted quickly.

Call me if you want to and I'll step out.

Love you babe xxx
