- pt head metal blank
- letter boxes metal blanks
- big kf flange blanked
- hdpe window replaced with metal blank
	- hdpe leaks like a sieve
- green electrical tape around seals (a la MUSCAT)
- am worried that chimney pipe has small (~mid e-8) leak
	- have green electrical tape on upward weld

- try and test for weld leaks first, so keep tape on and slowly squirt helium and watch
	- timelag is LONG so need to be patient
