		- Dear Dr. Ken Wood and Dr. James Cox
		  We would like to ask you a question about the NTD Ge Bolometer that we purchased from you, because there is strange noise that we do not understand.
		  Since when we purchased the NTD Ge Bolometer, we had a problem that interference waveforms around 300 GHz were sometimes detected in scanning Fabry-Perot spectroscopy using a metal mesh etalon, even though there was no millimeter-wave source. Kawase and Dr. Wood discussed this noise problem in the car on the way to a conference in Canada several years ago, but could not identify the cause.
		  Recently, we found out that the noise might be coming from inside the NTD Ge Bolometer.ã€€The details are given in the attached PDF file.
		  Please let me know the possible causes and countermeasures for this noise.
		  Best regards,
		  Sota Mine and Kodo Kawase
		  Nagoya University, Japan.

			- video  shows dc level from bolometer rising when the mirror is rotated in front of it
				- this isnt surprising to me as a reflective mirror will let the bolometer see the cold parts of itself
				- they seem to be effectively moving a reflective mirror in front of the optical window, which will generate a signal
					- delta between 300K and ~~60K (1st Stage)
-
- DONE fully understand experiment and why they want a reflective mirror at this stage
