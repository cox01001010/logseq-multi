More on our conversation last night

As discussed can you provide me with a spec for an amplifier to bias/readout  our detectors

I guess

Bandwidth  (both to and bottom)

_Gain_

_Noise contribution_

(not sure how these are specified, as the output is is from the biasing circuit)

Type of output (BNC)

Diagnostic information

Customer information (LED that it on, detector connected etc)

P/S voltage (5v?)

  
## questions are:

- Bandwidth  (both to and bottom)

- Gain

- Noise contribution

(not sure how these are specified, as the output is is from the biasing circuit)

- Type of output (BNC)

- Diagnostic information

- Customer information (LED that it on, detector connected etc)

- P/S voltage (5v?)
