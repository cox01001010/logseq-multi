fucking mess 

my familial problems bleed and take over mine and sadies relationship

# letter to sadie 

i have fucked this up so greatly. enough that i am sitting on a train being brought home to you with not knowing how i will be received or what i should do once i get there. you are all i ever wanted and i have hurt you and damaged this so badly. 25 years ago i didnt know how my life would pan out nor how i would be acting, but i was pretty sure this hypochrisy wouldnt be prevelant

i cant stand this distance between us nor this stilted way of acting.
