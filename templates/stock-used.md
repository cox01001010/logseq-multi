We are no longer tracking individual bits of dry systems as stock because it's not worth the hassle.

We just apply a total amount.

You'll see on the stock sheet that this is what has been used so far this year:

I don't know how such precise values were arrived at.

It looks to me as if something round £9000 would do.

We do not have to get this particularly accurate - on here it is just to give some idea of what the job cost, and at the end of the year (not long now!) we'll tot up what we still have in the lab and correct if required.
